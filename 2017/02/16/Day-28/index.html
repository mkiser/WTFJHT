  <p>1/ <strong>Donald Trump delivered a series of raw and personal attacks on the media in a news conference for the ages</strong>. It was a return to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he used the media — and his supporters’ distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn’t just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn’t), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked. There was a rawness to his attacks, a personal invective that seemed well beyond the typically antagonistic relationship that exists between the media and the president they cover. This was not a piece of political strategy. This came right from Trump’s gut. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-series-of-raw-and-wild-attacks-on-the-media-in-a-press-conference-for-the-ages/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fact-checking Trump’s press conference</strong>. Here’s the rundown of the event. (<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/16/fact-checking-donald-trumps-press-conference/" target="_blank">PoltiFact</a>)</li>

  <li><strong>The most memorable lines from Trump’s news conference</strong>. His back-and-forth with reporters touched on everything from his critique of the media, his Electoral College margin of victory, the workings of his administration, former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation and more. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/most-memorable-lines-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>2/ <strong>Trump laments, “I inherited a mess,” as he names new labor pick</strong>. Trump’s first choice for labor secretary is R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general for civil rights. Acosta is the first Hispanic to be tapped for Trump’s cabinet. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/alexander-acosta-labor-secretary-trump.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Spies keep sensitive intelligence from Trump, underscoring deep mistrust</strong>. U.S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive intelligence from Trump because they are concerned it could be leaked or compromised. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spies-keep-intelligence-from-donald-trump-1487209351" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Office of Director of National Intelligence: We don’t withhold intel from Trump</strong>. “Any suggestion that the U.S. Intelligence Community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true,” an ODNI statement said. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/office-director-national-intelligence-trump-intel-wsj-235080" target="_blank">Politico</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>4/ <strong>House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz asks the Department of Justice to investigate the leaks surrounding Michael Flynn</strong>. The steady stream of “potentially classified” intelligence community leaks that have thrown the Trump administration into turmoil. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chaffetz-leaks-michael-flynn-235079" target="_blank">Politico</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>In FBI interview last month Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador</strong>. The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy, as lying to the FBI is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flynn-in-fbi-interview-denied-discussing-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador/2017/02/16/e3e1e16a-f3d5-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Harward says no to national security adviser role</strong>. A friend of Harward’s said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a “s*** sandwich,” the friend said. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/harward-says-no-to-national-security-adviser-role/" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>U.S. allies intercepted a series of communications between Trump advisers and Russian officials before the inauguration</strong>. Sources said the interceptions include at least one contact between former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and a Russian official based in the U.S. (<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/allies-intercept-russia-trump-adviser-communications-557283" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>5/ <strong>White House plans to have a Trump ally review intelligence agencies</strong>. Trump’s plan to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies has members of the intelligence community fearing it could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies-stephen-feinberg.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trump’s professed love for leaks has quickly faded</strong>. As a candidate, Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Clinton’s emails to the press, declaring “I love WikiLeaks!” Trump has changed his mind. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/leaks-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>6/ <strong>The Kremlin ordered state media to cut way back on their fawning coverage of Trump</strong>, reflecting a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought. In January, Trump received more mentions in the media than Putin, relegating the Russian leader to the No. 2 spot for the first time since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after four years as premier. (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-16/kremlin-said-to-tell-media-to-cut-back-on-fawning-trump-coverage" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>GOP senators unnerved by Trump-Russia relationship</strong>. While Republicans aren’t yet willing to endorse a special investigative committee, GOP senators have indicated that could change. Democrats are treading carefully in hopes that Republicans make their concerns public and support a thorough and public investigation of contacts between Trump and Russia. (<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/319800-gop-senators-unnerved-by-trump-russia-relationship" target="_blank">The Hill</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>7/ <strong>Businesses across U.S. close, students skip school on “Day Without Immigrants”</strong> to underscore how much migrants form the lifeblood of the country’s economy and social structure. Immigrants in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and other major U.S. cities plan to stay home from work and school as part of a strike. Demonstrators also planned a march to the White House. (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/16/a-day-without-immigrants-strike/97965460/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>)</p>

<p>8/ <strong>ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse</strong>. A hearing in El Paso County in Texas went from ordinary to “unprecedented” last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her. She left under arrest. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/this-is-really-unprecedented-ice-detains-woman-seeking-domestic-abuse-protection-at-texas-courthouse/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>The White House has found ways to end protection for “Dreamers” while shielding Trump from blowback</strong>. Trump’s aides have examined at least two options for repealing DACA that would not directly involve Trump: a lawsuit brought by states, and new legal guidance that details who is a priority for deportation. Trump repeatedly promised to end the program on “day one” of his presidency and called the protections “unconstitutional executive amnesty.” (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-daca-20170216-story.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>9/ <strong>Leaked emails show Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife pushing travel ban</strong>. In an email sent to a conservative listserv, Ginni Thomas asked for advice on how to organize in favor of Trump’s travel ban. But by doing so, she may have inadvertently made it harder for the executive order to survive the Supreme Court. (<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/16/leaked-emails-show-justice-clarence-thomas-s-wife-pushing-travel-ban.html" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a>)</p>

<p>10/ <strong>Trump signs law rolling back disclosure rule for energy and mining companies</strong>. The bill cancels out a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation that would have required oil and gas and mining companies to disclose in detail the payments they make to foreign governments in a bid to boost transparency in resource-rich countries. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-signs-law-rolling-back-disclosure-rule-for-energy-and-mining-companies/2017/02/14/ccd93e90-f2cd-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>11/ <strong>The Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list</strong>. A Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act” unfolded just as supporters of the law had feared, with round after round of criticism from Republican lawmakers who said the federal effort to keep species from going extinct encroaches on states’ rights, is unfair to landowners and stymies efforts by mining companies to extract resources and create jobs. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/15/the-endangered-species-act-may-be-heading-for-the-threatened-list-this-hearing-confirmed-it/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>12/ <strong>The EPA posted a mirror of its site before Trump can cut the real one</strong>. The mirror is an archive of the site the way it appeared the day before Trump took office. (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-epa-posted-a-mirror-of-its-website-before-trump-can-gut-the-real-one-vgtrn" target="_blank">Vice</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>E.P.A. workers try to block Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency in show of defiance</strong>. Employees of the E.P.A. have been calling their senators, urging them to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E.P.A. offices say the calls are a last resort. Pruitt has made a career out of fighting the agency. Trump has vowed to “get rid of” it. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Oklahoma judge orders EPA nominee Scott Pruitt to turn over emails to watchdog group</strong>. The Center for Media and Democracy charges Pruitt violated the Oklahoma Open Records Act for declining to make public official documents the group has requested since 2015. (<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/16/judge-holds-hearing-on-whether-epa-nominee-violated-transparency-law.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>13/ <strong>More than 200 Republicans in Congress are skipping February town halls with constituents</strong>. After outpourings of rage at some early town halls, many Republicans are opting for more controlled Facebook Live or “tele-town halls,” where questions can be screened by press secretaries and followups are limited. (<a href="https://news.vice.com/story/more-than-200-republicans-in-congress-are-skipping-february-town-halls-with-constituents" target="_blank">Vice News</a>)</p>

<p>14/ <strong>Christie says Trump made him order the meatloaf when they dined together at the White House</strong>. Trump pointed out the menu and told people to get whatever they want. Then he said he and Christie were going to have the meatloaf. (<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/02/16/christie-says-trump-made-him-order-meatloaf-meal-together/ocBdUJgphM8lK10xWM6TkJ/story.html" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a>)</p>
