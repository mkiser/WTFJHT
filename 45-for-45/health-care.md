<p class="lead">Nobody really knows what the future holds for Obamacare, but we can expect that fewer Americans will be covered by health insurance. Sad!

1/ **Republican lawmakers fret about how to repeal Obamacare**. Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party’s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act inside a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-closed-doors-republican-lawmakers-fret-about-how-to-repeal-obamacare/2017/01/27/deabdafa-e491-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 2, 2017</h2>

2/ **The G.O.P. campaign to repeal Obamacare hits a wall**. Republicans are struggling to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/the-campaign-to-destroy-obamacare-hits-a-wall.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 9, 2017</h2>

3/ **Republican Senator admits GOP health-care plan has to remain secret because it will be unpopular**. Senator Mike Lee insists that Republicans repeal Obamacare first, before they decide on an alternative. And his reason is straightforward: If people saw the Republican alternative, they might not like it! ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/republican-admits-why-gop-health-plan-must-remain-secret.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 13, 2017</h2>

4/ **House conservatives fret GOP is blowing Obamacare repeal**. Hard-liners are plotting a major push to repeal the law immediately without simultaneously approving an alternative. Trump has sent conflicting signals, initially saying he wanted Congress to act immediately but then cautioning the process could take all year. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/obamcare-conservatives-repeal-replace-234983){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 14, 2017</h2>

5/ **Doubts grow that GOP can repeal Obamacare**. Republicans are sniping over how much of the law to scrap, what to replace it with and when. At this moment, it’s far from a sure thing any plan could get through Congress. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/obamacare-repeal-replace-republicans-235020){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 16, 2017</h2>

6/ **House G.O.P. leaders outline their plan to replace Obamacare**. Their plan leans heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. They did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/affordable-care-act-congress.html){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Republican health proposal would redirect money from poor to rich** The Republican plan would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work the same flat credit by age, regardless of income. The draft proposal largely contains provisions that could be passed through a special budget process that requires only 50 Senate votes, and fulfills President Trump’s promise that the repeal and replacement of the law would take place “simultaneously.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/upshot/republican-health-proposal-would-redirect-money-from-poor-to-rich.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 23, 2017</h2>

8/ **Repeal of Obamacare face obstacles in House, not just the Senate**. Conservative Republicans are pushing for a fast repeal with only a bare-bones replacement plan, but moderates are interested in coming up with a clear and robust plan. It’s becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House may be just as hard to reach. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/politics/obamacare-affordable-care-act-house-republicans.html){:target="_blank"})

9/ **Pence: “America’s Obamacare nightmare is about to end.”** In a 21-minute speech, Pence ticked through issues on which the administration has acted or plans to act soon, including cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, ending illegal immigration, expanding the military and restoring what he termed the “culture of life.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/23/vp-pence-americas-obamacare-nightmare-is-about-to-end/){:target="_blank"}) 

<h2 class="dateline">February 24, 2017</h2>

10/ **Republican lawmakers expect that their Obamacare replacement will result in fewer Americans covered by health insurance**. The new plan would do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans have health coverage or pay a fine, and replace it with rules that let people choose not to buy insurance, instead paying higher premiums or penalties if they need it later. The result would be fewer people covered. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-24/gop-obamacare-plan-would-cover-fewer-people-blowback-grows){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 27, 2017</h2>

11/ **GOP’s new plan to repeal Obamacare: Dare fellow Republicans to block the effort**. Republican leaders are betting that the only way for Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act is to set a bill in motion and gamble that wavering rank-and-file Republicans don’t have the guts to block it. Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about forging ahead with a repeal plan that could leave millions with no coverage — especially after enduring raucous town hall events during last week’s recess. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-new-plan-to-repeal-obamacare-dare-fellow-republicans-to-block-effort-1488154291){:target="_blank"})

12/ **Trump urges insurers to work together to “save Americans from Obamacare.”** Trump met with major health insurers in the midst of political divisions over how to dismantle and replace Obama’s signature health-care law and intensifying public pressure to preserve the policy. He criticized the Affordable Care Act for creating minimal health coverage requirements that restricted the types of plans insurers could sell. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/27/trump-urges-insurers-to-work-together-to-save-americans-from-obamacare/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 28, 2017</h2>

13/ **Republican governors divided on Obamacare replacement**. States that expanded Medicaid coverage fear they’‘ll be left holding the bag if the federal government doesn’t provide enough money to pay for the entitlement they expanded under the Affordable Care Act. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/02/28/daily-202-republican-governors-divided-on-obamacare-replacement/58b4e423e9b69b1406c75cfb/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">March 1, 2017</h2>

14/ **Fundamental disagreements remain between Republican leaders and the party’s most conservative members around the plan to replace the Affordable Care Act**, particularly over the details of a proposed tax credit. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/affordable-care-act-health-care-trump.html){:target="_blank"})

15/ **House Republicans announce only Republicans are allowed to see the new health care plan**. Paul Ryan had previous boasted that they were “not hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the American people’s front door.” Oh well... ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/only-republicans-are-allowed-to-see-new-health-care-plan.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">March 2, 2017</h2>

16/ **Paul Ryan’s feeling confident about repeal-and-replace. McConnell not so much**. Ryan and his top lieutenants are increasingly optimistic they will have the votes to pass their version of legislation to repeal the health-care law and replace some elements of it. In the Senate, McConnell can lose just two GOP senators and then use Vice President Pence to cast the tiebreaking vote to get the legislation to President Trump’s desk. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/paul-ryans-feeling-confident-about-repeal-and-replace-mcconnell-not-so-much/2017/03/02/d931b26a-ff59-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html){:target="_blank"})

17/ **Rand Paul protests outside room where House Republicans are hammering out an Obamacare replacement**. Paul couldn’t get a copy because the bill is still being drafted in private. Paul has described the passage of the ACA as an opaque and secret-laden process and that that Republican Party shouldn’t act the same way. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/02/rand-paul-protests-outside-room-where-republicans-are-hammering-out-obamacare-replacement/))

<h2 class="dateline">March 3, 2017</h2>

18/ **The GOP’s bold prediction: Obamacare repeal will pass this month**. Trump is reportedly on board, which suggests the House is poised to steamroll conservative opposition by daring their constituents to vote against an Obamacare repeal. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-leaders-obamacare-repeal-pass-month-235623){:target="_blank"})

19/ **New details in of the GOP Obamacare replacement leak**. The latest plan still includes a new tax credits for individuals based on age, which hardline conservatives have derided as “Obamacare lite.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-obamacare-repeal-bill-what-does-it-say-235648){:target="_blank"})
