<p class="lead">What the fuck? It’s only been 45 days? It feels like four years.</p>

<p>This project started as an effort to personally keep up with a news cycle that could only be described as “shock and awe.” Every day I saw multiple big stories coming out of the White House. And every day I struggled to get a sense of the bigger picture. There never seemed to be an “edge” — an end to the day’s news. And, when faced with a seemingly limitless amount of news, hot takes, and sensationalized clickbait posts, how is anybody able to actually be an informed citizen? And what if you aren’t a news junkie or have, you know, an actual life to tend to? </p>

<p>The daily news blitzkrieg is by design and undermines a democracy with the intent of fatiguing normal people into submission. By answering the question “what the fuck just happened today?” this project attempts to provide a daily antidote to an impossible news cycle. But every once in a while you need to zoom out, gain some perspective, and observe the larger trends and stories. </p>

<p>So, in honor of America's 45th president, let’s step back and take a look at the five big storylines from 45’s first 45-days in office. Check out the links below and share it on <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwhatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com%2F45-for-45%2F&via=WTFJHT&text=The%20Normal%20Person%27s%20Guide%20to%2045%27s%20First%2045%20Fucking%20Days" target="_blank">Twitter</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/45-for-45/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong>. –Matt </p>
