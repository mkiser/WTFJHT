1/ **Trump executive order suspends admission of all refugees for 120** days while a new system is put in place to tighten vetting for those from predominantly Muslim countries and give preference to religious minorities. Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priority for admission would be given to Christians. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-approves-extreme-vetting-of-refugees-promises-priority-for-christians/2017/01/27/007021a2-e4c7-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **The extreme vetting plan to establishes a religious test** for refugees from Muslim nations. The order also stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. ([New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Trump’s immigration ban excludes countries with business ties**. His proposed list doesn’t include Muslim-majority countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey. ([Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">January 28, 2017</h2>

4/ **Facing intense criticism, some Republicans are speaking out against Trump’s refugee ban**. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren’t among them. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/paul-ryan-trumps-refugee-ban-does-not-target-muslims/2017/01/28/e0cf1fe4-e56e-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Trump’s order blocks immigrants at airports, stoking fear around the globe**. The executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the executive order also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States. ([New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Trudeau says Canada will take refugees banned by U.S**. He also intends to talk to Trump about the success of Canada’s refugee policy. ([PBS](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trudeau-canada-refugees-banned-u-s/){:target="_blank"})

7/ **A federal judge issued a stay against Donald Trump’s "Muslim Ban."** The ruling – a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office – protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called “Muslim ban.” It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed. ([Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/muslim-ban-federal-court){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">January 29, 2017</h2>

8/ **Trump’s first defeat**. The immigration order creates an international mess and a political embarrassment. The hastily crafted order was temporarily and partially blocked by a U.S. District Court Judge.

<h2 class="dateline">February 4, 2017</h2>

10/ **Appeals court rejects request to immediately restore travel ban**. A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump’s immigration order. The ruling meant that refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations would, for now, continue to be able to enter the country. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/us/politics/visa-ban-trump-judge-james-robart.html){:target="_blank"})

11/ **Homeland Security suspends travel ban**, and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban. The White House announced the Justice Department would file an emergency motion to stop the halt, but it had yet to do so as of Saturday afternoon. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.

<h2 class="dateline">February 5, 2017</h2>

12/ **Pence defends Trump’s criticism of judge who blocked travel ban**. “The judge’s actions in this case,” Mr. Pence added, “making decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it’s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/donald-trump-mike-pence-travel-ban-judge.html){:target="_blank"}) 

13/ **97 companies file opposition to Trump’s immigration order**. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and other tech companies filed an amicus brief voicing opposition to Trump’s executive order on immigration on the grounds that it is discriminatory and has a negative impact on business. ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/05/twitter-airbnb-and-others-to-file-opposition-to-trumps-immigration-order/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 7, 2017</h2>

14/ **9th Circuit Court of Appeals to hear challenge to Trump’s ban** today. The issue in front of the court at the moment is whether the ban will remain suspended for now. The hour-long hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p.m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump’s travel ban. The three-judge panel is expected to rule this week. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/politics/9th-circuit-court-of-appeals-trump-travel-ban/){:target="_blank"})

15/ **Trump: I’ll take “common sense” travel ban to the Supreme Court**, if necessary. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/07/trump-ill-take-common-sense-travel-ban-to-the-supreme-court-if-necessary/){:target="_blank"}) 

16/ **Appeals Court panel appears skeptical of Trump’s travel ban**. The appeals court judges seemed taken aback by the assertiveness of the administration’s position, which in places came close to saying the court was without power to make judgments about Trump’s actions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-hearing-appeal.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 9, 2017</h2>

17/ **The 9th Circuit Court refused to reinstate travel ban**, delivering the latest and most stinging judicial rebuke to Trump’s effort to tighten the standards for entry into the United States and make good on a campaign promise. The ruling was focused on the narrow question of whether the travel ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness. The decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/politics/appeals-court-trump-travel-ban.html){:target="_blank"})

18/ **Republicans push bill to split up “nutty 9th Circuit.”** They argue that the 9th is too big, too liberal and too slow resolving cases. If they succeed, only California, Oregon, Hawaii and two island districts would remain in the 9th’s judicial fiefdom. Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska would be part of the brand new 12th Circuit. ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/09/bill-to-split-nutty-9th-circuit-gains-momentum.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 10, 2017</h2>

19/ **White House now says it may take travel ban to the Supreme Court**. Minutes after one White House official said Trump would not appeal the 9th Circuit ruling upholding a temporary stay of the travel ban, Reince Priebus said the White House is now “reviewing all of our options in the court system,” including possibly going to the Supreme Court. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-considers-rewriting-trumps-immigration-order/2017/02/10/ddcf5a6a-efb5-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html){:target="_blank"})

20/ **Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge**. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses. These teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/immigration-raids-enforcement.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 11, 2017</h2>

21/ **Trump: Refugees are flooding the U.S. and creating a “dangerous” situation** after the judge blocked his travel ban. The percentage of refugees arriving from the so-called seven banned countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — has risen considerably since the directive was suspended. However, the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. All are stringently vetted. Trump made the post at the start of a day of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort in Jupiter, Florida. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/refugees-donald-trump-syria.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 12, 2017</h2>

22/ **Federal immigration officials arrested more than 600 people across at least 11 states last week**, detaining 40 people in the New York City area, law enforcement officials said. It’s unclear whether the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were part of continuing operations to round up illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or a ramping-up of deportations by the Trump administration.

<h2 class="dateline">February 13, 2017</h2>

23/ **Courts still proceeding with lawsuits — and a new injunction — against Trump’s travel ban**. While the Justice Department lawyers attempted to confine the court battle to the federal appeals court hearing the challenge out of Washington, two district court judges on Monday sided with challengers to the president’s executive order. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/justice-department-appears-to-rule-out-seeking-immediate-sup?utm_term=.eqBzzdQo1#.euRQQ8RqM){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 14, 2017</h2>

24/ **A DREAMer was arrested during a raid and now a federal magistrate judge has ordered officials to defend the arrest** of an undocumented immigrant who has protection from deportation. Attorneys filed a lawsuit accusing federal authorities of unlawfully arresting a Mexican immigrant in Seattle despite him having protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

<h2 class="dateline">February 15, 2017</h2>

25/ **Leaked emails show Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife pushing travel ban**. In an email sent to a conservative listserv, Ginni Thomas asked for advice on how to organize in favor of Trump’s travel ban. But by doing so, she may have inadvertently made it harder for the executive order to survive the Supreme Court.

<h2 class="dateline">February 16, 2017</h2>

26/ **Trump promises new immigration order as DOJ holds off appeals court**. Trump said his administration will issue “a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people” next week. The Justice Department wrote at length in a 47-page about the “seriously flawed” Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but nevertheless said: “(r){:target="_blank"})ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-executive-order/index.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 18, 2017</h2>

27/ **Trump weighs mobilizing National Guard for immigration roundups**. A draft memo proposes to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border. The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/5508111d59554a33be8001bdac4ef830){:target="_blank"})

28/ **US doesn’t plan to use National Guard to arrest immigrants**. The White House and Department of Homeland Security both said they are not planning to use the National Guard to apprehend and arrest undocumented immigrants, despite a “preliminary draft memo” that indicated doing so was a possibility. ([ABC News](https://apnews.com/5508111d59554a33be8001bdac4ef830){:target="_blank"})

29/ **Trump weighs new travel ban that won’t stop green card holders or travelers already on planes from entering the U.S.** The Homeland Security chief says there will be a “short phase-in period” to avoid people being stopped in transit. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15X0O6){:target="_blank"})

30/ **Memos signed by DHS secretary describe sweeping new guidelines for deporting illegal immigrants**. The new guidelines empower federal authorities to more aggressively detain and deport illegal immigrants inside the United States and at the border. A White House official said the memos were drafts and that they are under review by the White House Counsel’s Office, which is seeking some changes. The memos do not include measures to activate National Guard troops. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/memos-signed-by-dhs-secretary-describe-sweeping-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants/2017/02/18/7538c072-f62c-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 20, 2017</h2>

31/ **Revised travel ban targets same seven countries** listed in Trump’s original executive order and exempts travelers who already have a visa to travel to the U.S. The new draft also no longer directs authorities to single out — and reject — Syrian refugees when processing new visa applications. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/ap-source-trumps-revised-travel-ban-targets-same-countries/2017/02/19/e09c9ab2-f70a-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 21, 2017</h2>

32/ **Homeland Security unveils a sweeping plan to deport undocumented immigrants**. The memos instruct all agents, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify, capture, and quickly deport every undocumented immigrant they encounter. The vast majority of the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants are at risk of deportation. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/21/donald-trump-homeland-security-issues-deportation-memos/98190192/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 23, 2017</h2>

33/ **Trump has assigned the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice Department, to help build the legal case for its temporary travel ban**. Some administration intelligence officials see the White House request as the politicization of intelligence. One of the ways the White House hopes to make its case is by using a more expansive definition of terrorist activity than has been used by other government agencies in the past. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/white-house-effort-to-justify-travel-ban-causes-growing-concern-for-some-intel-officials/){:target="_blank"})

34/ **Trump touts recent immigration raids, calling them a “military operation."** The effort to ramp up deportations are aimed at ridding the U.S. of “really bad dudes.” Under the administration’s guidelines, any immigrant who is convicted, charged or suspected of a crime is considered a priority for removal. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/23/trump-touts-recent-immigration-raids-calls-them-a-military-operation/){:target="_blank"})

35/ **Trump’s plan to hire 15,000 border patrol and ICE agents won’t be easy**. The time to recruit and hire Border Agents, administer medical exams and drug screening, polygraph tests, fitness tests, and training could take a year or more to bring a new agent on board. Customs and Border Protection has also had a problem retaining Border Patrol agents: the agency is down some 1,600 agents from the 21,000 it’s authorized for. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516712980/trumps-plan-to-hire-15-000-border-patrol-and-ice-agents-wont-be-easy-to-fulfill){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 24, 2017</h2>

36/ **He yelled “get out of my country,” and then shot 2 men from India**, killing one. A 51-year-old man faces first-degree murder charges after shooting three men in an Olathe, Kansas bar Wednesday night. He reportedly told two local Garmin engineers from India to “get out of my country.” Authorities would not classify the shooting as a hate crime, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating with local police to determine if it was “bias motivated.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/24/get-out-of-my-country-kansan-reportedly-yelled-before-shooting-2-men-from-india-killing-one/){:target="_blank"})

37/ **DHS report disputes threat from banned nations**. Analysts at the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump’s travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States. ([Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/39f1f8e4ceed4a30a4570f693291c866/dhs-intel-report-disputes-threat-posed-travel-ban-nations){:target="_blank"})

38/ **A Department of Homeland Security report casts doubt on the need for Trump’s travel ban**. The report concludes that citizenship is an “unreliable” threat indicator and that people from the banned countries have rarely been implicated in U.S.-based terrorism. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-report-casts-doubt-on-need-for-trump-travel-ban/2017/02/24/2a9992e4-fadc-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">February 28, 2017</h2>

39/ **Trump envisions a compromise bill allowing many immigrants to stay in US** where those who aren’t serious or violent criminals could stay in the US legally, hold a job and pay taxes, without having to worry about being deported. A path to citizenship for those in the country illegally would not be part of Trump’s vision for this deal, with the possible exception of “Dreamers” – those brought into the US illegally as children. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/trump-immigration-bill/index.html){:target="_blank"})

40/ **Trump called on the Department of Homeland Security to “create an office to serve American victims” of crimes committed by immigrants**. The Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) would provide “a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.” He made no explanation as to why the targets of crime perpetrated by immigrants should receive the support of a new federal government agency that apparently excludes the victims of crime committed by U.S. citizens. ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/28/trump-calls-for-new-government-agency-for-victims-of-crime-by-immigrants.html){:target="_blank"})

41/ **Trump delays signing new travel ban order**. The delay was due to a busy news cycle, and Trump wanted the new execeutive order to get it’s own “moment.” Signing the executive order today, as originally planned, would have undercut the favorable coverage of Trump’s speech. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/trump-travel-ban-visa-holders/){:target="_blank"})

<h2 class="dateline">March 1, 2017</h2>

42/ **Police chiefs object to Trump’s efforts to involve them in immigrant deportations**. A letter from more than 60 law enforcement heads asks to soften push to include police in round-ups, saying it makes their communities less safe. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/01/police-chiefs-letter-trump-deportation-immigrants){:target="_blank"})

43/ **New Trump order drops Iraq from travel ban list**. The decision follows pressure from the Pentagon and State Department, which had urged the White House to reconsider Iraq’s inclusion given its key role in fighting the Islamic State group.
