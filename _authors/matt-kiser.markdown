 3. **A new entrant that displays perhaps the most accurate encapsulation of this peculiar moment** takes the form of an independent email blast: “What The Fuck Just Happened Today?” The aptly named roundup does the yeoman’s work. ([Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/criticism/donald-trump-news-cycle-slow-news-day.php))

 4. **How WTF Just Happened Today? is Rethinking Membership**. It feels like a million years ago now, but in January 2017 the headlines were dominated by discussions over the size of the crowd at President Trump’s inauguration, “alternative facts,” the Women’s March, the Travel Ban, and more. What started as a side project for Kiser had unexpectedly grown into a more substantial undertaking. Kiser quit his job and began working on WTFJHT full time. The project has continued past the 100-day mark. Now he had to make a living from it. And he had to figure out how to grow it. ([The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/solutions-resources/wtf-just-happened-today-rethinking-membership/))

 5. **Combine an “editorially responsible” algorithm \+ political news, and you have Current Status**. “I see my role as a sort of reinforcement editor, ensuring that the good stuff is always percolating to the top.

12. **Follow these newsletters by journalists and never miss a thing**.

Every piece of news is described with a single sentence, which pretty much summarizes the gist of it all. ([The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/the-best-newsletters-by-journalists))

13. **Seattle’s Tech Community Is Fighting Trump One Piece of Code at a Time**. Every day since Trump took office, Matt Kiser has woken up at six in the morning. He grabs a coffee and scans thousands of news sources on the administration’s latest exploits. It sounds like a shitty way to start the day. ([The Stranger](https://www.thestranger.com/features/2017/04/26/25106297/seattles-tech-community-is-fighting-trump-one-piece-of-code-at-a-time))

14. **Popular newsletter uses open-source techniques to cover ‘WTF’ is happening with Trump**. Anybody can edit a file and submit a pull request.

16. **Don’t get raked, keep abreast of daily shock and awe from DC**. Kiser does an ace job of the old blogger skill called “curating.” His lists surface themes and suggest lines that might connect dots. His headlines make dark poetry of careering developments. ([Colorado Statesman](https://www.coloradostatesman.com/dont-get-raked-keep-abreast-with-darkly-entertaining-news-from-dc/))

([Glamour](http://www.glamour.com/story/these-11-apps-make-it-super-easy-to-make-a-difference))

18. **Happy Not My President’s Day weekend! Here’s where to show up & protest**. I feel like that’s the thought that crosses my mind every time I sit down to write this little intro, but the sheer amount of news is dizzying. It is important, however, to make sure you’re at least getting a taste of all the week’s events, even if you don’t have time to read 600 articles.

30. **What does it take to have "members" of a news organization rather than consumers of its products?** “When you're member-funded, you're obligated to ask for permission when shifting course, because you work for your members – you're in the relationship business."

35. **Here are some of the ways you might be doing email newsletters inefficiently (and how to do them better)**. Matt Kiser of What the Fuck Just Happened Today formally started using the Osmosys tool about three weeks ago, but had been able to beta test and work with Yellow Brim on tailoring the way the tool works to suit his workflow earlier. ([Nieman Lab](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/06/here-are-some-of-the-ways-you-might-be-doing-email-newsletters-inefficiently-and-how-to-do-them-better/))

36. **WTF Just Happened Today and Reciprocal Relationships with Audiences**. On his community page, Matt Kiser describes WTF Just Happened Today as “your guide to the daily shock and awe in national politics.” What started as a personal project to chronicle the new administration has turned into Kiser’s full-time job, and he couldn’t do it without the help of his readers. ([Gather](https://letsgather.in/lightning-chats/lightning-chat-summary-wtf-just-happened-today-and-reciprocal-relationships-with-audiences/))

37. **Reclaiming “the edge.”** Seek out content with a clear beginning and end, something you can pick up and put down at will. An NPR podcast has edges, for instance; an NPR livestream doesn’t. Kiser’s newsletter has edges, too, though the homepages he tabs through each morning are edgeless. Incidentally, this recommendation mirrors the advice of many psychologists, who encourage overwhelmed news consumers to establish “boundaries” around their media diets.
