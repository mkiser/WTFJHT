1. **Meet the wildly popular blogger chronicling President Trump one day at a time**. The site is easy to read, easy to parse and easy to share. There are no ads, and WTF Happened Today makes it easy to see news in context with what happened yesterday and the day before that. ([Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2017/meet-the-wildly-popular-blogger-chronicling-president-trump-one-day-at-a-time/))

2. **A new entrant that displays perhaps the most accurate encapsulation of this peculiar moment** takes the form of an independent email blast: “What The Fuck Just Happened Today?” The aptly named roundup does the yeoman’s work. ([Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/criticism/donald-trump-news-cycle-slow-news-day.php))

3. **How WTF Just Happened Today? is Rethinking Membership**. It feels like a million years ago now, but in January 2017 the headlines were dominated by discussions over the size of the crowd at President Trump’s inauguration, “alternative facts,” the Women’s March, the Travel Ban, and more. What started as a side project for Kiser had unexpectedly grown into a more substantial undertaking. Kiser quit his job and began working on WTFJHT full time. The project has continued past the 100-day mark. Now he had to make a living from it. And he had to figure out how to grow it. ([The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/solutions-resources/wtf-just-happened-today-rethinking-membership/))

4. **Combine an “editorially responsible” algorithm + political news, and you have Current Status**. “I see my role as a sort of reinforcement editor, ensuring that the good stuff is always percolating to the top. Sometimes the news isn’t as neat as an algorithm wants to make it.” ([Nieman Lab](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/combine-an-editorially-responsible-algorithm-political-news-and-you-have-current-status/))

11. **Follow these newsletters by journalists and never miss a thing**.

Every piece of news is described with a single sentence, which pretty much summarizes the gist of it all. ([The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/the-best-newsletters-by-journalists))

12. **Seattle’s Tech Community Is Fighting Trump One Piece of Code at a Time**. Every day since Trump took office, Matt Kiser has woken up at six in the morning. He grabs a coffee and scans thousands of news sources on the administration’s latest exploits. It sounds like a shitty way to start the day.

15. **Don’t get raked, keep abreast of daily shock and awe from DC**. Kiser does an ace job of the old blogger skill called “curating.” His lists surface themes and suggest lines that might connect dots. His headlines make dark poetry of careering developments. ([Colorado Statesman](https://www.coloradostatesman.com/dont-get-raked-keep-abreast-with-darkly-entertaining-news-from-dc/))

Unlike the White House and its staff, Kiser is dedicated to facts and to accuracy. Every entry on the site includes a link to the news source that first reported it. ([Liberal America](http://www.liberalamerica.org/2017/02/10/best-new-website-read-what-fck-happened-every-day/))

27. **Seattle man’s website helps millions figure out the daily tumult in the other Washington**.

([Membership Puzzle Project](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/members-vs-consumers))
