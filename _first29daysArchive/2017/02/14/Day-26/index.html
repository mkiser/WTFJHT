  <p>1/ <strong>Russia has secretly deployed a new cruise missile</strong> despite violation of the arms control treaty that helped seal the end of the Cold War. The move presents a major challenge for President Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Putin and to pursue future arms accords. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Trump knew Flynn misled officials on Russia calls for “weeks”</strong> the White House says. The comment contrasts the impression Trump gave aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a report that revealed Flynn had not told the truth about the calls. White House counsel Don McGahn told Trump in a January briefing that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/14/trump-was-told-weeks-ago-that-flynn-misled-vice-president-about-russia-contacts-white-house-says/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The timeline of Michael Flynn’s resignation looks bad for the Trump White House</strong>. Was the White House concerned that Flynn had apparently lied to them — or at least done something he shouldn’t have and failed to disclose it? Would it ever have taken corrective action if the situation hadn’t been made public? (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/14/the-timeline-of-michael-flynns-resignation-is-troubling-for-the-trump-white-house/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>The F.B.I. interviewed Flynn in the first days of the Trump administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador</strong>. If he was not entirely honest with the F.B.I., it could expose Flynn, who resigned his post, to a felony charge. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/fbi-interviewed-mike-flynn.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Flynn sets record with only 24 days as national security adviser</strong>. The average tenure is about 2.6 years. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/14/flynn-sets-record-with-only-24-days-as-nsc-chief-the-average-tenure-is-about-2-6-years/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>3/ <strong>A member of the Senate Intelligence Committee calls for an exhaustive investigation into Trump-Russia connections following Flynn’s resignation</strong>. “The national security adviser of all the people that work with and for the President has to be absolutely trustworthy and truthful and apparently he wasn’t and he paid the price for that…” (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/kfile-roy-blunt-flynn-investigation/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>

  <li><strong>McConnell: Flynn investigation “highly likely” in Senate committee</strong>. The Senate’s second-ranking Republican and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the episode, building on a string of investigations underway on Russian interference in the US elections. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/republicans-want-flynn-investigations/" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>House Republicans rejected calls for an independent investigation into Flynn’s communications with Russia</strong>, laying bare the party’s reticence to challenge Trump in the early weeks of his presidency. The chair of the intelligence committee said he was less concerned with investigating Flynn’s conduct than with the question of who was behind the leaks that quickly spiraled into the former official’s dramatic resignation. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/14/congress-republicans-michael-flynn-investigation" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Democrats demand that Flynn’s resignation spur broader Russia investigation</strong>. In a joint statement, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said, “We in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/donald-trump-administration-michael-flynn-resignation.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>FBI needs to explain why Flynn’s call were recorded</strong> with the Russian ambassador and later leaked information to the press. Intelligence officials had recorded Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Those recordings  appeared to contradict Flynn’s own claims that he had not discussed easing U.S. sanctions on Russia. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/14/fbi-needs-to-explain-why-michael-flynn-was-recorded-gop-intelligence-chairman-says/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</li>

<p>4/ <strong>Ethics office: Conway committed “clear violation” with Ivanka plug</strong> and recommends that the White House investigate  Trump’s senior adviser.
