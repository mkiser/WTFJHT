    <p>1/ <strong>Trump weighs mobilizing National Guard for immigration roundups</strong>. A draft memo proposes to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border. The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. (<a href="https://apnews.com/5508111d59554a33be8001bdac4ef830" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Migrants choose arrest in Canada over staying in the U.S.</strong> People who work with immigrants in Canada say these border-jumpers would rather be arrested in Canada than live in fear of how U.S. officials might handle their cases. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/17/515662976/migrants-choose-arrest-in-canada-over-staying-in-the-u-s" target="_blank">NPR</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>2/ <strong>Senate on track to confirm Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator</strong> despite calls from Democrats to delay until he turns over thousands of requested emails from his time as attorney general as part of a public records lawsuit. Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Pruitt’s nomination last month in an effort to delay his confirmation. Republican leaders have shown no signs they intend to wait for the documents to be released before voting to confirm him. (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/senate-track-confirm-scott-pruitt-epa-administrator-45555994" target="_blank">ABC News</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>Senate confirms climate-change skeptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA, an agency he sued as Oklahoma attorney general</strong>. Pruitt’s confirmation marked a serious defeat for environmental advocacy groups. Pruitt has sued the EPA more than a dozen times during the Obama administration, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants and the quality of wetlands and other waters. In Oklahoma, he dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his Democratic predecessor and established a “federalism unit” to combat what he called “unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach” by Washington. Pruitt cleared the Senate by a vote of 52-46. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/17/scott-pruitt-long-time-adversary-of-epa-confirmed-to-lead-the-agency/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Trump – under fire – returns to his scorched-earth politics that served him during the campaign</strong>. He’ll continue his campaign-style reboot with a rally in Florida, reuniting with the devoted supporters who view Trump as a political crusader dedicated to the obliteration of Washington’s elites. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/donald-trump-politics-campaign/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>More Democrats call on Sessions to withdraw from Russia probe</strong>. A letter sent to Sessions by 55 lawmakers asks him to withdraw based on his ties to Trump’s campaign and key figures who have been alleged to have ties to Russia. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/17/more-democrats-call-on-sessions-to-withdraw-from-russia-probe/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>5/ <strong>House G.O.P. leaders outline their plan to replace Obamacare</strong>. Their plan leans heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. They did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/affordable-care-act-congress.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>Republican strategist Ana Navarro hits Kushner for complaining about CNN: “Oh, baby boy, I’m so sorry”</strong>. Kushner complained to an executive of Time Warner, CNN’s parent company, about unfair coverage of the Trump administration on CNN. (<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/320044-ana-navarro-hits-kushner-for-complaining-about-cnn-oh-baby-boy" target="_blank">The Hill</a>)</p>

<p>7/ <strong>Chaffetz seeks charge of ex-Clinton aide in email inquiry</strong>. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has refused Democratic requests to investigate possible conflicts of interest involving Trump, is seeking criminal charges against a Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department employee who helped set up Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Chaffetz sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to convene a grand jury or charge Pagliano. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/chaffetz-seeks-charge-of-ex-clinton-aide-in-email-inquiry/2017/02/16/28673692-f4a7-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>8/ <strong>Tillerson aides layoff staff at the State Department</strong>. While Rex Tillerson is on his first overseas trip as Secretary of State, staffers were told that their services were no longer needed at the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources and the Counselor offices. (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-layoffs-under-rex-tillerson-being-carried-out/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>)</p>

<p>9/ <strong>Trump has a four-person short list for his national security adviser after retired Harward turned down the job.</strong> Trump gave no indication on how soon a decision could be made, but he is expected to move quickly even as questions grow over contacts with Russia by the former security adviser, Michael Flynn. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/16/trumps-pick-to-replace-michael-flynn-as-national-security-adviser-turns-down-offer-people-familiar-with-decision-say-2/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>10/ <strong>Trump hires Mike Dubke as White House communications director</strong>. The Crossroads Media founder will relieve pressure on Sean Spicer, who has been both the press secretary and communications director since Trump took office, which have traditionally been separate positions. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/17/trump-expected-to-tap-mike-dubke-as-his-communications-director/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>11/ <strong>Ryan struggles to sell tax reform plan to fellow Republicans</strong>. Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff, which the president wants, and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes. He has suggested it’s in keeping with Trump’s “America first” mantra, since it would reward American manufacturers that make products here and sell it abroad. But the idea is sharply dividing Republicans — even within the White House. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/paul-ryan-tax-reform-republicans-235117" target="_blank">Politico</a>)</p>

<p>12/ <strong>Trump promises new immigration order as DOJ holds off appeals court</strong>. Trump said his administration will issue “a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people” next week. The Justice Department wrote at length in a 47-page about the “seriously flawed” Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but nevertheless said: “(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>13/ <strong>Trump call the news media “the enemy of the American people”</strong> in his escalating war against journalists. Trump has regularly referred to the media as the “opposition party,” and has blamed news organizations for stymieing his presidential agenda. But the language he deployed typically used by presidents to refer to hostile foreign governments or terrorist organizations.

    <p>1/ <strong>Donald Trump delivered a series of raw and personal attacks on the media in a news conference for the ages</strong>. It was a return to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he used the media — and his supporters’ distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn’t just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn’t), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked. There was a rawness to his attacks, a personal invective that seemed well beyond the typically antagonistic relationship that exists between the media and the president they cover. This was not a piece of political strategy. This came right from Trump’s gut. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-series-of-raw-and-wild-attacks-on-the-media-in-a-press-conference-for-the-ages/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

</ul>

<p>2/ <strong>Trump laments, “I inherited a mess,” as he names new labor pick</strong>. Trump’s first choice for labor secretary is R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general for civil rights. Acosta is the first Hispanic to be tapped for Trump’s cabinet. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/politics/alexander-acosta-labor-secretary-trump.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Spies keep sensitive intelligence from Trump, underscoring deep mistrust</strong>. U.S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive intelligence from Trump because they are concerned it could be leaked or compromised. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spies-keep-intelligence-from-donald-trump-1487209351" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Office of Director of National Intelligence: We don’t withhold intel from Trump</strong>. “Any suggestion that the U.S. Intelligence Community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true,” an ODNI statement said. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/office-director-national-intelligence-trump-intel-wsj-235080" target="_blank">Politico</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>4/ <strong>House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz asks the Department of Justice to investigate the leaks surrounding Michael Flynn</strong>. The steady stream of “potentially classified” intelligence community leaks that have thrown the Trump administration into turmoil. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/chaffetz-leaks-michael-flynn-235079" target="_blank">Politico</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>In FBI interview last month Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador</strong>. The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy, as lying to the FBI is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flynn-in-fbi-interview-denied-discussing-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador/2017/02/16/e3e1e16a-f3d5-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Harward says no to national security adviser role</strong>. A friend of Harward’s said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a “s*** sandwich,” the friend said. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/harward-says-no-to-national-security-adviser-role/" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>U.S. allies intercepted a series of communications between Trump advisers and Russian officials before the inauguration</strong>. Sources said the interceptions include at least one contact between former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and a Russian official based in the U.S. (<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/allies-intercept-russia-trump-adviser-communications-557283" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>5/ <strong>White House plans to have a Trump ally review intelligence agencies</strong>. Trump’s plan to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies has members of the intelligence community fearing it could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies-stephen-feinberg.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trump’s professed love for leaks has quickly faded</strong>. As a candidate, Trump embraced the hackers who had leaked Clinton’s emails to the press, declaring “I love WikiLeaks!” Trump has changed his mind. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/leaks-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</li>
</ul>

    <p>1/ <strong>Michael Flynn resigns as National Security Adviser</strong> after it was revealed that he had misled  Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn served in the job for less than a month. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE:</p>

  <p><strong>Flynn on thin ice but still in at the White House after turbulent few days</strong>. Despite a turbulent 72 hours caused by the national security adviser’s inability to deny that he spoke about sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office, Flynn has no plans to resign and no expectations that he will be fired. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-white-house/" target="_blank">CNN</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Flynn apologizes after admitting he may have discussed sanctions with Russia</strong>. The apology was directed most notably to Pence, who had emphatically denied to CBS News last month that Flynn had discussed “anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.” (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/flynn-apologizes-after-admitting-he-may-have-discussed-sanctions-russia/97852248/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>The Justice Department had warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail</strong>. Current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn’t rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>Trump declines to say whether he has full confidence in Flynn</strong>, deferring to a statement to come. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/13/515049707/conway-national-security-adviser-flynn-has-trumps-full-confidence" target="_blank">NPR</a>)</p>

  <li><strong>Trump remains silent as Flynn falls under growing pressure</strong>. Neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or stated unequivocally that he has the president’s confidence. Privately, some administration officials said that Flynn’s position has weakened and support for him has eroded largely because of a belief that he was disingenuous about Russia and therefore could not be fully trusted going forward.

If he can’t, he would have to start using a series of so-called extraordinary measures to extend the deadline for several weeks to avoid a U.S. default on its debt.

Trump also threatened to block federal funds if California goes ahead with plans to become a sanctuary state for immigrants.

The new administration is targeting dozens of Obama-era policies, using both legislative and executive tactics.

<p>10/ <strong>America’s biggest foreign creditors dump Treasuries in warning to Trump</strong>. Few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it’s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world’s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing. And then there is Trump’s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier.

<p>11/ <strong>Trump ran a campaign based on intelligence security. That’s not how he’s governing.</strong> The president discussed a national security incident in a public room, with phone flashlights lighting the way. Why is this important? Mobile phones have flashlights — and cameras, microphones and Internet connectivity. Phones — especially phones with their flashes turned on for improved visibility — are portable television satellite trucks and, if compromised, can be used to get a great deal of information about what’s happening nearby, unless precautions are taken.

    <p>1/ <strong>Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge</strong>. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses.

    <p>1/ <strong>Appeals court rejects request to immediately restore travel ban</strong>. A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump’s immigration order. The ruling meant that refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations would, for now, continue to be able to enter the country.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

  <p>A judge in a lower federal court had put a temporary stop to the travel ban. Because the appeals court declined to intervene immediately, affected travelers can enter until at least until Monday. The appeals court set a schedule asking challengers to the ban to file a response by roughly 3 a.m. Eastern on Monday, and the Justice Department — representing the Trump administration — to reply to that by 6 p.m.</p>

  <p>Trump administration had said it was improper for a lower court to engage in “second-guessing” of President Trump’s controversial immigration order and asked the appeals court to dissolve the judge’s order that stopped its implementation.

    <p>1/ <strong>Trump Picks Neil Gorsuch, A Scalia Clone, For The Supreme Court.</strong> Ideologically, Gorsuch would almost certainly represent a reliably conservative vote and voice. Gorsuch would be the most conservative justice save for the silent stalwart Justice Clarence Thomas and would sit somewhere just to the right of the ideological space occupied by Scalia. (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-trump/">FiveThirtyEight</a>)</p>

  <li><strong>Make Republicans nuke the filibuster to confirm Gorsuch.</strong> Once Mitch McConnell blockaded Barack Obama’s last Supreme Court nomination, and then Donald Trump carried the Electoral College, the chance that Republicans would fill the vacancy rose to 100 percent. McConnell already indicated that he does not respect Democrats’ right to filibuster, and that he would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations if one is used. It is McConnell, his extraordinary blockade tactic, who has functionally changed the rules of the game. He should be forced to do it in name.

    <p>1/ <strong>Hill staffers secretly worked on Trump’s immigration order.</strong> Several House Judiciary Committee aides helped craft the controversial directive without telling Republican leaders.

    <p>1/ <strong>Trump’s first defeat.</strong> The immigration order creates an international mess and a political embarrassment. The hastily crafted order was temporarily and partially blocked by a U.S. District Court Judge.

<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE: <strong>Trump doubles down on his executive order barring refugees</strong> and some legal immigrants from entering the United States, even as one of his top aides walked back one major element of the order, signaling a growing sense of confusion and fissures within the 10-day-old administration. (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-refugees-234320">Politico</a>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>2/ <strong>Despite growing dissent, Trump gives no sign of backing down from travel ban</strong> even as lawmakers from both parties spoke out against the action and federal judges ruled against parts of it. Judicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement President Trump’s action.

<p>3/ <strong>A clarifying moment in American history.</strong> There should be nothing surprising about what the Donald Trump has done in his first week, but he had underestimated the resilience of Americans and their institutions.

<p>4/ <strong>Donald Trump, the refugee ban, and the triumph of cruelty.</strong> The reasons for Trump’s ban on refugees could not be more feeble, and could not be more petty. It serves no actual security purpose. You have a better chance of getting killed by a train, or by your own clothes catching on fire, than by an immigrant terrorist attack. The odds of a refugee killing you in a terrorist strike are about 1 in 3.6 billion. That’s about four hundred times less likely than being hit by lightning twice. If you look back at significant terrorist attacks in the US like San Bernardino or the Pulse nightclub shooting or 9/11, exactly none of them would have been prevented by this policy.

<p>5/ <strong>Trump puts Bannon on security council, dropping joint chiefs.</strong> The reshuffling of the National Security Council downgrades the military chiefs and gives a regular seat to his chief strategist Steve Bannon. The director of national intelligence and the joint chiefs will attend when discussions pertain to their areas. (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38787241">BBC</a>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>6/ <strong>Trump signs two more executive actions.</strong> The first bans administration officials who leave government from lobbying those federal agencies for five years, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The second is a memorandum giving military leaders 30 days to construct and present a “comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,” stating that “there can be no accommodation or negotiation” with the group.

    <p>1/ <strong>Trump’s order blocks immigrants at airports, stoking fear around the globe.</strong> The executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the executive order also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States.

  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees who were trapped at airports across the United States.</p>

  <p>The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Trump’s actions.</p>

But throughout his business career, Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals.

    <p>1/ <strong>Trump executive order suspends admission of all refugees for 120 days</strong> while a new system is put in place to tighten vetting for those from predominantly Muslim countries and give preference to religious minorities. Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priority for admission would be given to Christians.

<p>2/ <strong>The extreme vetting plan to establishes a religious test</strong> for refugees from Muslim nations. The order also stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>The order will block 500,000 legal U.S. residents from returning to American from trips abroad.</strong> The president has also used language that will affect those who are in the U.S. already on visas and green cards. (<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america/">ProPublica</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>Trump’s immigration ban excludes countries with business ties.</strong> His proposed list doesn’t include Muslim-majority countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey. (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>Following Trump’s executive order green card, visa holders already blocked by airports.</strong> Within hours of the executive order limiting immigration from Muslim countries, green card and visa holders were already being blocked from getting on flights to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 p.m. ordering the Customs and Border Protection to enforce the executive order. People who were still in the air as of 10:30 p.m. likely face being blocked at the airport when their planes land, he said.

<p>7/ <strong>A little-noticed move by Trump could make it easier to deport immigrants.</strong> The move stripped federal privacy protections from many immigrants, raising fears among advocacy groups that information people willingly submitted to the federal government during the Obama administration could now be used to help deport them.

<p>12/ <strong>Trump’s first seven days in office were historic, chaotic, astonishing and unsettling.</strong> With a flurry of provocative executive orders, surreal events, unapologetic falsehoods and did-he-really-say-that tweets, Trump continued to obliterate political norms, serving notice that the gaze of history won’t change who he is.

<p>14/ <strong>Pence vows “full evaluation of voting rolls” over claims of fraud.</strong> In a private meeting with congressional Republicans this week, the Trump administration would pursue a wide-ranging probe of voting rolls in the United States to examine whether millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election as President Trump has charged.

    <p>1/ <strong>Steve Bannon says media should “keep its mouth shut.”</strong> Trump’s chief strategist, laced into the American press during an interview, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by an election outcome few anticipated, and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>2/ <strong>One of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science.</strong> It is no coincidence that the rise of Trump is concurrent with the rise of “fake news.” It is no coincidence that his rise comes during an age of severely damaged faith in institutions. Our president is a pathological liar. Say it. Write it. Never become inured to it. And dispense with the terms of art to describe it. A lie by any other name portends the same. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/a-lie-by-any-other-name.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Fake news is about to get even scarier than you ever dreamed.</strong> What we saw in the 2016 election is nothing compared to what we need to prepare for in 2020. If there’s one thing we learned from this election cycle, it is that there are a number of reasons that people create fake-news stories. And, it has become clear that most new consumers don’t want to know if what they are reading is real or fake; they just want to know that it helps support their worldview. (<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology">Vanity Fair</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>The State Department’s entire senior management team resigned.</strong> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s job running the State Department just got considerably more difficult. The entire senior level of management officials resigned as part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don’t want to stick around for the Trump era.

<p>7/ <strong>(The cost of) Trump’s wall keeps getting higher and higher.</strong> Republican Congressional leaders signaled plans to move forward with Trump’s planned border wall, estimated to cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. That’s well below many outside estimates of the construction cost (let alone maintenance), but is significantly higher than what Trump himself has said in the past.

    <p>1/ <strong>Trump’s voter fraud example?</strong> A troubled tale about Bernhard Langer meant to illustrate rampant, unchecked voter fraud. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Langer was standing in line at a polling place on Election Day. Ahead of and behind Langer were voters who “did not look as if they should be allowed to vote.” Langer left feeling frustrated. <em>Here’s the problem:</em> Langer, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., is a German citizen with permanent residence status in the United States who is, by law, barred from voting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2/ <strong>Declining trust in government is denting democracy.</strong> America, which has long defined itself as a standard-bearer of democracy for the world, has become a “flawed democracy” according to the taxonomy used in the annual Democracy Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although its score did not fall by much – from 8.05 in 2015 to 7.98 in 2016 – it was enough for it to slip just below the 8.00 threshold for a “full democracy”. (<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20">The Economist</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Trump’s impulses now carry the force of the presidency.</strong> Impetuous and instinctive, convinced of broad, but hidden plots to undermine him, eager to fight and prone to what an aide called “alternative facts,” Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/donald-trump-presidency.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>Those flashy executive actions could run aground.</strong> The White House failed to consult with many of the agencies and lawmakers who will be critical for their success.

<p>2/ <strong>Trump orders the construction of a Mexican border wall.</strong> It’s the first in a series of actions to curtail immigration and bolster national security. It includes slashing the number of refugees who can resettle in the United States and blocks Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering  temporarily. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Federal works told to stop talking to Congress and the press.</strong> The freeze has startled aides on the Hill and people at those agencies, who worry that it could abruptly upend current operations and stifle work and discussions that routinely take place between branches of government. (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-communication-freeze_us_58878b3ae4b0441a8f7114e2">Huffington Post</a>)</p>

(<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/315876-trump-bans-epa-employees-from-giving-social-media-updates">The Hill</a>)</p>

<p>5/ <strong>USDA scientists have been put on lockdown.</strong> “Starting immediately and until further notice” the department’s main research division “will not release any public-facing documents,” according to an internal memo. UPDATE: The order was rescinded by the department on Tuesday. (<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/legacy_mobile/dinograndoni/trump-usda">Buzzfeed</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>USDA disavows gag-order emailed to scientific research unit.</strong> An internal email sent to staff at its Agricultural Research Service unit this week calling for a suspension of “public-facing documents,” including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-usda-idUSKBN1582OB">Reuters</a>)</p>

<p>7/ <strong>A National Park deleted tweets on climate change after Trump silenced federal scientists.</strong> The tweets were posted by a former employee and officials decided to delete them because the account had been “compromised,” a National Parks official said. (<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/a-national-park-is-tweeting-facts-about-climate-change-in-de">Buzzfeed</a>)</p>

<p>8/ <strong>GOP Rep.: ‘Better to get your news directly from the president.”</strong> The chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee said that Donald Trump was a more credible news source than the entire press corps.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spicer: The media “disposition should be” Trump is correct “unless we can prove otherwise”</strong></p>

  <p>“…at some point, the disposition should be he is going to do it unless we can prove otherwise. He has shown through every step of the way that he’s going to win. And so it just seems to me it’s just odd that if those are the odds, if you are looking at his track record, the track record is a proven track record of success and winning. And yet, the media’s default is on every scenario, whether it’s hasn’t nominees getting through or winning a primary or him accomplishing something, it’s immediately negative and a failure.” (<a href="https://mediamatters.org/video/2017/01/24/trump-press-secretary-media-disposition-should-be-trump-correct-unless-we-can-prove-otherwise/215116">Media Matters</a>)</p>

<p>9/ <strong>Trump’s disregard for the truth threatens his ability to govern.</strong> In the first five days of his presidency, Trump has put the enormous power of the nation’s highest office behind spurious — and easily disproved — claims. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-disregard-for-the-truth-threatens-his-ability-to-govern/2017/01/24/945c81aa-e272-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>10/ <strong>Trump dogged by insecurity over popular vote, media coverage.</strong> He might hold the most powerful office in the world, but he’s dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say. (<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/61415760238042f2ad7bc38acc2f468c/trumps-bridge-building-eclipsed-false-voter-fraud-claim">Associated Press</a>)</p>

<p>11/ <strong>For Trump, everything is a rating.</strong> Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1.8 million in 2009 — “looked like a million, a million and a half.” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/arts/television/for-trump-everything-is-a-rating.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>12/ <strong>Trump 101: What he reads and watches.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With an allergy to computers and phones, he works the papers. With a black Sharpie in hand, he marks up the Times or other printed stories. When he wants action or response, he scrawls the staffers’ names on that paper and either hands the clip to them in person, or has a staffer create a PDF of it — with handwritten commentary — and email it to them. An amazed senior adviser recently pulled out his phone to show us a string of the emailed PDFs, all demanding response. It was like something from the early 90s. Even when he gets worked up enough to tweet, Trump told us in our interview he will often simply dictate it, and let his staff hit “send” on Twitter.

<p>13/ <strong>“We the People” demand Trump release his tax returns.</strong> One of the features on the White House website that didn’t vanish when President Trump took the oath of office on Friday is the “We the People” page, which allows ordinary Americans to petition their government to address an issue of importance to them. The Obama White House, which created the feature, responded to petitions that received at least 100,000 signatures within 30 days.

    <p>1/ <strong>The first days inside Trump’s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot.</strong> President Trump had just returned to the White House on Saturday from his final inauguration event, a tranquil interfaith prayer service, when the flashes of anger began to build. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-first-days-inside-trumps-white-house-fury-tumult-and-a-reboot/2017/01/23/7ceef1b0-e191-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Spicer: ‘Negative’ Trump coverage is ‘demoralizing’</strong> The White House press secretary pushed back at what he said was negative coverage of the Trump White House, describing the media narrative as “demoralizing. It’s not just about a crowd size. There’s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,” Spicer said of Trump. (<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315721-spicer-negative-trump-coverage-is-demoralizing">The Hill</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>No White House leaks like this… until now.</strong> The Trump White House not only leaks like crazy. It casually leaks the most intimate and humiliating details about the President - hurt feelings, ego injury, childlike behavior, self-destructive rages over tweets, media failure to credit his own grandiosity. We have simply never seen this level of leaking, with this little respect for the President’s dignity or reputation, this early. (<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/no-white-house-leaks-like-this-until-now">Talking Points Memo</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.</strong> Days after being sworn in, President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victory.

<p>5/ <strong>Why Trump’s staff is lying.</strong> One of the most striking features of the early Trump administration has been its political uses of lying. The big weekend story was the obviously false claim that Trump pulled in the largest inauguration crowds in American history. This raises the question of why a leader might find it advantageous to promote such lies from his subordinates. (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-23/why-trump-s-staff-is-lying">Bloomberg</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>The Right is building a new media “upside down” to tell Trump’s story.</strong> Armed with its own set of facts, the right has created a parallel media universe that’s risen all the way with Trump to the White House. (<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-right-is-building-a-new-media-upside-down-to-tell-donald">Buzzfeed</a>)</p>

<p>7/ <strong>Trump pays a fence mending visit to the CIA after weeks of mocking U.S. intelligence officials.</strong> Trump told staffers that he’s now with them, “a thousand percent.” (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/01/23/511165541/president-trump-pays-a-fence-mending-visit-to-the-cia">NPR</a>)</p>

  <p><strong>CHUCK TODD:</strong> –was Zeke Miller. Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They’re falsehoods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4/ <strong>Alternative facts are a needless lie by the Trump Administration.</strong>
If the president and his aides will tell easily disproven falsehoods about crowd sizes and speeches, what else will they be willing to dissemble about? (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/the-pointless-needless-lies-of-the-trump-administration/514061/">The Atlantic</a>)</p>

<p>5/ <strong>The traditional way of reporting on a president is dead. And Trump’s press secretary killed it.</strong> The presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he’s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called “a ratings machine.” (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-traditional-way-of-reporting-on-a-president-is-dead-and-trumps-press-secretary-killed-it/2017/01/22/75403a00-e0bf-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>The costs of Trump-branded reality: America’s credibility.</strong> When Trump swore the presidential oath, he assumed responsibility not only for the levers of government but also for one of the United States’ most valuable assets, battered though it may be: its credibility. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>7/ <strong>Meanwhile, Trump’s top aides are troubled by his rocky first weekend in office</strong>, unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-aides-rocky-first-weekend.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>8/ <strong>WikiLeaks calls out Trump for refusing to release tax returns.</strong> (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/wikileaks-trump-tax-return-234000">Politico</a>)</p>

<p>9/ <strong>Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments</strong>, a team of prominent constitutional scholars, Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers say.

<p>2/ <strong>White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds.</strong> “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” Spicer said, contradicting all available data. Aerial photos have indicated that former president Barack Obama’s first inauguration attracted a much larger crowd. Nielsen ratings show that Obama also had a bigger television audience. Spicer, at times almost yelling while reading a prepared statement, took no questions. (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media</strong>, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>Trump says he has “running war” with media, criticizes the “dishonest media,” gets facts wrong, in CIA speech.</strong> (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/donald-trump-war-with-the-media/">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>5/ At CIA headquarters, Trump denies feud, lashed out at critics, boasted of his magazine covers, and <strong>exaggerated the size of the crowd at his inauguration.</strong> (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-cia-langley-233971">Politico</a>)</p>

<p>6/ <strong>Trump’s real war isn’t with the media. It’s with facts.</strong> He needs to delegitimize the media because he needs to delegitimize facts. (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347952/trump-spicer-press-conference-crowd-size-inauguration">Vox</a>)</p>

    <p>1/ <strong>Donald Trump has named only 29 of his 660 executive department appointments</strong>, the Partnership for Public Service said. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/trump-cabinet-picks-inauguration.html">NY Times</a>)</p>

<p>2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an “unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.” <strong>But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.</strong> (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama">Vox</a>)</p>

<p>3/ <strong>All references to climate change have been deleted</strong> from the White House website. The only mention of climate on Trump’s new website is under his “America First Energy Plan” page, in which he vows to destroy Obama’s Climate Action Plan, which is a government-wide plan to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. (<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website">Motherboard</a>)</p>

<p>4/ <strong>New poll shows Obamacare is more popular than Donald Trump.</strong> Fox News finds that 50% of voters feel favorably about the Affordable Care Act compared to Donald Trump, whom 42% view favorably. President Obama received an approval rating of 60%. (<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14335268/obamacare-more-popular-than-trump-poll">Vox</a>)</p>

<p>5/ <strong>There’s no record Trump has resigned from his companies.</strong> To transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. (<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so">ProPublica</a>)</p>
