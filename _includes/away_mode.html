  <p><strong>🦃 Programming note</strong>: I’ll be publishing editions of WTFJHT on Monday and Tuesday this week. After that, I’m taking a short break for the holiday and will be back in your inbox on Monday, December 1st (unless, of course, something truly wtf-y demands otherwise). Thanks, as always, for reading and letting me be part of your news routine. I’m glad you’re here. -MATT</p>
