1. **Russia and Turkey reached a deal to push Kurdish fighters out of northeastern Syria, allowing Russia's ally Bashar al-Assad to regain control over more of the country's territory**. The agreement was reached after an hours-long meeting between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Once the operation is complete, Turkey and Russia will control territory formerly held by Kurdish forces who were once allied with the U.S. before Trump ordered an abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region. Under the agreement, Russia and the Syrian government planned to begin removing Kurdish militias starting at noon on Wednesday from a large part of the border that extends hundreds of miles from the Euphrates River to Iraq, an area more than 20 miles deep.

2. **Turkey halted its incursion into Kurdish-run Syria just hours after reaching a deal with the Russian government to retake roughly 900 square miles of territory from the Kurds**. "At this stage," the Turkish defense ministry said in a statement, "there is no further need to conduct a new operation outside the present operation area." Kurdish authorities were not involved in the talks between Putin and Erdogan, and they have yet to respond to the deal. In earlier rounds of talks, the Kurds agreed to completely withdraw from a central stretch of the Syrian border with Turkey and allow Russian and Syrian government troops inside their area of control.
