1. **Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a raid by U.S. special forces in northwestern Syria**. Hours later, Islamic State spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was also killed in a separate joint raid by Kurdish-led and U.S. forces in northern Syria. Baghdadi, according to Trump, "blew himself up" with a suicide vest when cornered by U.S. forces at the end of a dead-end tunnel. Trump described Baghdadi's death in enthusiastic detail during a press conference on Sunday. "He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering, screaming and crying all the way," Trump said. "He died like a dog," Trump continued, he died like a coward." Baghdadi was one of the most wanted suspected terrorists in the world, with a $25 million bounty issued by the U.S. for his capture.

2. **Trump did not give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or other key members of Congress advance notice of the raid that killed Baghdadi**. Trump said he knew about plans for the top-secret mission for three days, but claimed that he kept Congress in the dark because he worried they would leak the information to the public and put the lives of American forces at risk. Pelosi says Trump informed Russia of the military operation before telling congressional leadership.

* **Trump knew the CIA and Special Operations commandos were zeroing in on the location of Baghdadi when he ordered American troops to withdraw from northern Syria earlier this month**. Trump's abrupt withdrawal order disrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid before their ability to control troops, spies and reconnaissance aircraft disappeared with the pullout.
