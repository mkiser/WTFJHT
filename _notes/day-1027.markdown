1. **The Trump administration is preparing to restrict the amount of scientific and medical research the government can use to inform public health regulations**. A new draft of the Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science proposal would also require scientists to disclose all raw data, including confidential medical records, before the EPA could consider the conclusions of an academic study. Scientists and physicians protested the move, arguing that it would make it more difficult to pass new clean air and water rules. The new proposal would also apply retroactively to all current public health regulations. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html))

2. **At least eight former White House, Trump transition team, and Trump campaign officials were hired as contractors by Health and Human Services and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year**. The money came from a $2.5 million contract through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which paid at least 40 consultants over the course of one year. The contractors collectively billed at least $744,000 over the course of a four-month period and received much higher rates than regular CMS staff and even top HHS appointees.

3. **Mick Mulvaney withdrew his request to join a federal lawsuit seeking a decision on whether top Trump officials can be compelled to testify** in the House impeachment inquiry. Instead, Mulvaney plans to file his own lawsuit seeking a decision on the same question. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-idUSKBN1XL1C2))

4. **Republicans circulated an 18-page staff memo outlining their strategic approach to the House impeachment inquiry**, which enters the public hearings phase tomorrow morning. House Republicans plan to argue that "the President's state of mind" made it impossible for him to have committed an impeachable offense during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Republicans plan to highlight "four key pieces of evidence" to defend against impeachment: the lack of conditionality on the July 25 call; the fact that Trump and Zelensky have said there was no pressure from Trump; Ukraine didn't know about the hold on U.S. military aid; and that the aid was eventually released even though Ukraine didn't launch an investigation into the Bidens.

5. **The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up a case today that will affect the deportation status of roughly 800,000 people who came to the U.S. as children**. The question before the Court is whether Trump improperly tried to end DACA by labeling it illegal without considering how it would affect immigrants. On Twitter, Trump said some DACA recipients were "very tough, hardened criminals," but said he would be open to cutting a deal with Democrats regarding the status of the so-called Dreamers if the Supreme Court rules in his favor and allows him to end the Obama-era program.
