1. **Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Trump at the White House**. It is the first time Erdogan has visited the U.S. since Turkey attacked U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria following Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. Trump and Erdogan are expected to discuss how to maintain the tentative ceasefire that exists in Syria, as well as the fate of the Islamic State fighters who remain detained in that country.

2. **Rudy Giuliani wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal to argue that Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wasn't an impeachable offense**. Giuliani argued that the focus of the call was only "Ukrainian corruption broadly" and that only a fraction of the call was spent asking Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. "Out of a five-page transcript," Giuliani wrote, "Mr. Trump spent only six lines on Joe Biden."

3. **Republicans want to distance Trump from his association with Rudy Giuliani as one of their defensive strategies in the House impeachment inquiry**. "So the point is," said a Republican on one of the impeachment committees, "as long as \[Giuliani\] is a step removed, \[Trump\]'s in good shape."

4. **Trump's senior advisers have been trying to convince him not to fire acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney**. Trump has been threatening to fire Mulvaney for weeks. Trump was especially upset by Mulvaney's Oct. 17 press conference, during which Mulvaney admitted that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was withheld as a way to pressure Zelensky to launch investigations that could benefit Trump politically.

5. **Jared Kushner is planning to set up webcams along the U.S.-Mexico border so people can watch livestream the construction of Trump's border wall**. Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials object to the plan because it will make the proprietary techniques of the construction contractors visible to their competitors. They were also concerned that the cameras would show U.S. work crews violating Mexican sovereignty if they stray south of the border to maneuver vehicles and equipment.
