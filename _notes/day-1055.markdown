1. **House Democrats are expected to unveil at least two articles of impeachment against Trump this morning, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress**. Members of the Judiciary Committee worked through the night to prepare the articles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated ahead of the release that Trump tried to "corrupt our upcoming elections" and that he remains a "threat to our democracy and national security." Trump, meanwhile, continues to insist that he did "NOTHING" wrong, and that impeaching a president with his record would be an act of "sheer Political Madness!"
