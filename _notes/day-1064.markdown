1. **Nancy Pelosi won't commit to sending the two articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate**. Senior Democratic aides said it was "very unlikely" that the House will send the articles to the Senate before January, effectively delaying the upcoming Senate impeachment trial. "We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side," she said. "So far we haven’t seen anything that looks fair to us." Sen. Mitch McConnell has bragged that he is working in close coordination with the White House to ensure that Trump is not removed from office.

2. **Rep. Mark Meadows will not seek re-election to Congress in 2020**. Meadows has been contemplating leaving office for months, but he finalized his decision this week.

He is also being considered to join Trump's impeachment defense team in preparation for the trial in the Senate.
