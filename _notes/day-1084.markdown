1. **Iran launched a missile strike against two Iraqi military bases that house U.S. troops** in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. More than a dozen ballistic missiles were fired at the al-Asad air base in western Iraq and another unnamed base inside the country. The attacks began at around 5:30 p.m. ET. The Iraqi prime minister said Iran warned his country about the attacks before they began. No U.S. or Iraqi casualties have been reported.

2. **Trump met with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night to discuss the Iranian missile attack and said he plans to make a statement Wednesday morning**.

3. **Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif defended the strike as an act of self-defense**. "Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter," Zarif tweeted, "targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched." Zarif also said that Iran does "not seek escalation or war," but said that his country will defend itself "against any aggression."

4. **The House Foreign Affairs Committee called for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify in a hearing on Iran next week**. Members of Congress want to know more about the decision to assassinate Iran's top military commander. The hearing will take place on Jan. 14 and will include a panel of Iran policy experts. The State Department has not responded to the request or indicated whether Pompeo will agree to testify. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-congress-hearing-idUSKBN1Z62Q6))

5. **New York state's highest court will decide whether Trump must face a defamation case brought against him by former contestant on "The Apprentice."** Summer Zervos says Trump kissed her against her will at a meeting in 2007 and later groped her at a Beverly Hills hotel. Trump denied the claims and called Zervos a liar, so she sued him for defamation. Trump has argued that he is immune from lawsuits, investigations, and criminal proceedings while he remains in office. A lower Appellate Division court in Manhattan voted 3-2 that Trump is "not above the law" even while in office. The court also ruled that Zervos' case is "materially indistinguishable" from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones' lawsuit accusing then-President Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, which paved the way for Clinton's impeachment.

6. **Trump's reelection campaign is planning to spend $10 million to advertise during the Super Bowl**. The campaign has purchased 60 seconds of commercial time during the Feb. 2 game. It is unclear whether the campaign will run a single minute-long ad or split the time between multiple, shorter ads.
