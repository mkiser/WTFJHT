1. **Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told the U.S. to come up with a mechanism for getting U.S. troops out of Iraq**. During a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mahdi said Iraq rejects all violations of its sovereignty, including both the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil by the U.S. and the barrage of ballistic missiles fired at Iraqi bases by Iranians in retaliation for Soleimani's killing. Mahdi asked Pompeo to "send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament’s resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq," according to a statement. The U.S. currently has more than 5,000 troops stationed in Iraq.
