1. **Trump and his adult sons suggested the Iowa Democratic caucuses were "rigged" and called them an "unmitigated disaster"** after state party officials delayed the release of the final results. While there has been no evidence to suggest that the caucuses were in fact "rigged," the confusion stemming from the delay has produced a steady stream of conspiracy theories and wild speculation. The Iowa Democratic Party said early Tuesday that it plans to release the results from the caucuses later in today after it finishes "manually verifying all precinct results."

3. **Trump waved his fingers in the air and pretended to conduct a band while a group of people stood for the national anthem during his own Super Bowl watch party on Sunday**. Video shows Trump greeting guests, adjusting his chair, and straightening his suit jacket as other attendees stand with their hands over their hearts. Trump has repeatedly demanded that all Americans "stand proudly" and respect the U.S. flag when the anthem is played and says those who don't are disrespecting the troops.
