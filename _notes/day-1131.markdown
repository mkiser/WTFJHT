1. **Trump and his allies have created detailed lists over the last 18 months of all the disloyal government employees they want to remove, along with a list of pro-Trump replacements.** A network of conservative activists with connections to Trump and top White House officials is secretly helping to develop the lists. Some even sent memos to Trump to shape his views. Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is one of those activists, along with Republican Senate staffer Barbara Ledeen. Aides say Trump is convinced that his administration is filled with "snakes" in the wake of his Senate impeachment acquittal and he wants the fired and replaced as soon as possible.
