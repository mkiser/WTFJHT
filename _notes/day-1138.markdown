1. **A second person in the U.S. died after contracting coronavirus, while New York and Florida have both confirmed their first positive cases**. The White House task force expressed "great concern" that there will more person-to-person transmissions of the disease, despite Trump's assurances that his team has things under control. Trump also accused Democrats of "fear mongering" and being unfair in their criticisms of his administration's response to the virus.

2. **A federal judge ruled that Trump's decision to appoint Ken Cuccinelli as acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.** U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said Cuccinelli was never eligible to become acting USCIS chief, and his appointment violated the FVRA because "he never did and never will serve in a subordinate role — that is, as an 'assistant' — to any other USCIS official." All policies put in place under Cuccinelli are now void, including an order that made it harder for asylum-seekers less time to consult with an attorney before undergoing their initial "credible fear" interview with immigration officers.

3. **The U.S. signed a tentative deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan.** The agreement calls for the U.S. to pull all 12,000 troops out of the country within the next 14 months if the Taliban agrees to sever its ties with al Qaeda meet other unspecific conditions. The first phase of the withdrawal would bring U.S. troops numbers down to 8,600 within 135 days. In exchange, the Taliban has agreed to engage in talks with the Afghan government and commits not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil to plot attacks against the United States or its allies. "Everybody’s tired of war," Trump said. "It’s been a very long journey. It’s been a hard journey for everybody."
