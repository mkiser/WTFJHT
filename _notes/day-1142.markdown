1. **The Trump Organization charged the Secret Service $157,000 more than was previously known and billed taxpayers for rooms at his clubs at much higher rates than the company claimed.** Newly obtained documents show Trump’s company has charged the Secret Service more than $628,000 since he took office in 2017. The full scope of the Trump Organization's business relationship with the Trump administration is still unknown because the only publicly available records are mostly from 2017 and 2018 — the rest are still hidden. The new documents show charges for 177 additional nightly room rentals in 2017, 2018, and 2019 at a rate of $396.15 per night per room. They also reveal that Trump charged the Secret Service $17,000 per month to rent a cottage near Trump's in Bedminster, NJ. There is no requirement that presidents charge the Secret Service for using space on their properties, and most presidents have provided space for free.

2. **Trump abruptly canceled a planned trip to CDC headquarters in Atlanta.** Mike Pence confirmed as late as 8:30 pm yesterday that the trip was still on, but a White House official said Friday morning that the trip was canceled because "the president does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency." Trump still plans to fly to Nashville to visit the site of a deadly tornado before heading to Florida where he was headline campaign fund-raising events and spend the rest of the weekend at Mar-a-Lago.
