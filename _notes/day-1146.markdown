1. **Trump's incoming White House chief of staff has quarantined himself after possibly coming in contact with a confirmed carrier of the coronavirus.** Rep. Mark Meadows is now the fifth Republican lawmaker to self-quarantine himself over fears coronavirus contamination. Sen. Ted Cruz and Reps. Paul Gosar, Doug Collins and Matt Gaetz have also quarantined themselves for 14 days out of caution. Meadows says he found out this weekend that he "may have come in contact" with the same infected person that Cruz and Gaetz did at CPAC last month. None of the lawmakers are currently showing any symptoms of COVID-19. Meadows, Cruz, Collins, and Gaetz all interacted with Trump on the day they were exposed. Trump named Meadows as his next chief of staff last week.

2. **Trump left a White House press briefing without answering questions about his health after coming in contact with multiple people who have self-quarantined over fears of COVID-19 contamination.** Shortly after Trump left, Pence told reporters he didn't know if Trump had been tested for the virus and that he had not been tested himself because he has received "no recommendation" that he do so. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later confirmed that Trump "has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms."

3. **Trump administration officials are scheduled to brief Congress in closed-door session on election threats from Russia and other foreign countries.** U.S. intelligence officials say Russian intelligence officials are attempting to incite white supremacists to violence and fuel chaos in the United States as part of an attempt to influence the 2020 election. In addition to its more public influence campaigns, Russia's lead intelligence service is also using private Facebook groups, anonymous message boards like 4chan, and other closed chat rooms that make it easier to avoid detection on social media.
