1. **Sens. Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler sold off more than a million dollars each in stocks in the days and weeks after attending private, senators-only briefings about the severity of the impending coronavirus crisis.** Burr is a Republican from North Carolina who serves as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He dumped between $582,029 and $1.56 million of his shares over a series of 33 transactions beginning on Feb. 13, just days after he wrote an op-ed for Fox News arguing that the U.S. is "better prepared than ever before" when it comes to facing public health threats like COVID-19. Burr was also one of only three senators in 2012 who voted in opposition to the STOCK Act, which explicitly prohibits lawmakers and their staff from trading on nonpublic information. Loeffler was recently elected as the newest Republican Senator from Georgia and is married to the chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. She and her husband dumped between $1,275,000 and $3,100,000 in jointly owned stocks over the course of 29 transactions starting on Jan. 24, the same day the Senate Health Committee on which she sits hosted a private, all-senators briefing about the virus from Trump administration officials and the head of the CDC. Only two of the 29 transactions Loeffler made during that time period were purchases, one of which was for $100,000 and $250,000 in shares of Citrix, a technology company that provides telecommuting software and services. Both Burr and Loeffler have denied any wrongdoing.

2. **Trump canceled plans to host the G7 summit in person at Camp David and will instead hold the gathering of world leaders as a teleconference.** Trump help a video conference with the other G7 leaders on Monday, which is apparently the first time the group has met completely online.  White House officials said holding the summit virtually will allow all countries involved to save money on travel and preparations, while also reducing the risk of further contamination.
