1. **Trump extended federal social distancing guidelines until at least April 30**. The extension is a reversal from last week, when Trump said he planned to relax coronavirus restrictions by Easter weekend. Trump said all Americans must continue to stay home when possible and avoid gatherings of 10 or more people for at least another month and possibly until June. "By June 1, we will be well on our way to recovery," Trump said. "We think by June 1, a lot of great things will be happening." Trump claimed his earlier predictions of an April 12 "reopening" of the country was simply "aspirational" and was not intended as an actual timeline. Dr. Anthony Fauci called the extension of social distancing guidelines a "wise and prudent decision." On Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of Americans could still die as a result of the coronavirus, even "if we do things almost perfectly" and take aggressive action to slow the spread.

2. **The Justice Department is investigating a series of stock transactions made by lawmakers in the weeks leading up to the coronavirus-related market crash.** The inquiry is still in its early stages and is being conducted in coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI has already reached out to one lawmaker — Sen. Richard Burr — with requests for information about his trades. The investigation hinges on whether lawmakers sought to profit from information they obtained from non-public briefings about the coronavirus pandemic. One of Burr's attorneys said Burr "welcomes a thorough review of the facts in this matter, which will establish that his actions were appropriate."

* [📌 ](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/20/day-1156/#4-at-least-four-senators-sold-off-mi)**[Day 1156:](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/20/day-1156/#4-at-least-four-senators-sold-off-mi) At least four senators sold off millions of dollars’ worth of stocks just before the market dropped amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic**. Sens. Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler sold off more than a million dollars each in stocks after attending private, senators-only briefings about the severity of the impending coronavirus crisis. Burr, who serves as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had been receiving daily updates from the intelligence community on threats to the U.S., including the coronavirus, before dumped up to $1.56 million on Feb. 13 – days after he wrote an op-ed for Fox News arguing that the U.S. is “better prepared than ever before” when it comes to facing public health threats like COVID-19. Loeffler, who is married to the chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and her husband sold up to $3.1 million in jointly owned stocks starting on Jan. 24 – the same day the Senate Health Committee, on which she sits, briefed senators briefing about the coronavirus. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a member of the intelligence committee, and her husband sold up to $6 million worth of stock in Jan. and Feb. And, Sen. James Inhofe sold as much as $400,000 in January. Burr said he has asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his sale.
