1. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he is open to reinstating Navy captain who was relieved of his post after asking for help dealing with a coronavirus outbreak aboard his ship**. Esper said his "inclination is always to support the chain of command," but that officials have "taken nothing off the table" when it comes to the possibility of reinstating Capt. Brett Cozier. Cozier was relieved after a letter he sent to Esper asking for help with the outbreak was leaked to the media.
