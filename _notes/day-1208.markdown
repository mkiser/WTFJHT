1. **Three members of the White House coronavirus task force will self-quarantine after possibly being exposed to COVID-19**. Dr. Anthony Fauci has begun a "modified quarantine" after he had "low risk" contact with a White House aide who tested positive last week for coronavirus. The "low risk" label means Fauci wasn't in close proximity to the aide during the time when they were known to be positive for the virus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control, will self-quarantine for 14 days. And FDA chief Stephen Hahn has been in self-quarantine since Friday. Fauci tested negative for COVID-19, according to a spokesperson, and he is "actively monitoring his temperature and other health indicators." Fauci and Redfield are scheduled to testify remotely on Tuesday before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

2. **Mike Pence is not planning to self-quarantine and will be working at the White House today, even though his press secretary tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday**. A spokesperson said in a statement that Pence plans to "continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine," adding that Pence has "tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House \[today\]." Trump confirmed on Friday that Pence's press secretary Katie Miller, wife of White House adviser Stephen Miller, had come into contact with Pence. Pence was absent from a White House on Saturday with Trump and top military officials.

3. **Thousands of additional coronavirus cases were reported in Texas just days after Gov. Greg Abbott allowed statewide stay-at-home orders to expire**. Coronavirus cases in the state spiked during the week following the lifting of the orders, with 7,090 new cases, compared to 5,763 the week before. Texas has tested less than 2% of its total population so far. The leading model for projecting coronavirus deaths in the U.S. once again increased its projections as governors continue to life social distancing measures and move toward reopening, now predicting that more than 137,000 Americans will die by early August.

4. **The former acting assistant attorney general for national security accused Attorney General William Barr of twisting her words to suggest that the FBI's interview with Michael Flynn in 2017 was illegitimate**. Mary McCord's interview with Flynn was used by Barr and the DOJ as evidence that the FBI had no valid counterintelligence reason to interview Flynn. McCord claims her interview with Flynn was "constitutional, lawful and for a legitimate counterintelligence purpose," but said Barr's motion to dismiss the charges against Flynn "makes a contorted argument that Mr. Flynnâ€™s false statements and omissions to the F.B.I. were not 'material' to any matter under investigation." McCord added that her interview doesn't support the DOJ's conclusion that the interview shouldn't have taken place, and said it was "disingenuous for the department to twist my words to suggest that it does."
