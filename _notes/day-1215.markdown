1. **Trump fired State Department inspector general Steve Linick, who had recently opened an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo**. Linick was investigating whether Pompeo made a staffer run personal errands for him, including walking his dog, picking up his dry cleaning, and dinner reservations for him and his wife. Trump informed Congress of the move in a letter, saying that he "no longer" had full confidence in Linick. Lawmakers from both parties criticized Linick's firing. "Congress requires written reasons justifying an IG's removal," said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley. "A general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient detail to satisfy Congress." Mitt Romney later called the firing "a threat to accountable democracy." Congressional Democrats have launched an investigation into Linick's firing to determine whether was an act of illegal retaliation intended to shield Pompeo from accountability.

2. **The bombshell report suggesting that the coronavirus was released from a lab in Wuhan, China was based on provably false evidence.** The 30-page report produced by defense contractor Sierra Nevada claims to rely on cell phone location data, social media postings, and commercial satellite imagery to conclude that some kind of "hazardous event" occurred in October 2019 at the Wuhan Institute for Virology, allowing COVID-19 to escape into the world. But the sample size for the cell phone data is too small, there are selfies taken at the conference the report claims was canceled the following month after the "hazardous event," and additional satellite imagery shows a much more mundane reason for the lack of traffic around the same time as the supposed incident: road construction. The director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies called the report "an illustrated guide on how not to do open source analysis."

3. **Eric Trump claimed that the coronavirus will "magically" disappear after the November election**. He suggested that the virus was a politically expedient Democratic ploy meant to prevent his dad from holding rallies across the country. Eric said his dad's "greatest tool" is "being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time," and suggested that social distancing restrictions and stay-at-home orders were part of a "cognizant strategy" by Democrats to keep Joe Biden competitive in the November election. "You watch, they’ll milk it every single day between now and November 3," Eric Trump told Fox News. "And guess what, after November 3, coronavirus will magically, all of a sudden, go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen."

4. **Trump will meet with the governor of Kansas at the White House today to discuss how to protect the U.S. food supply and agricultural sector from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic**. Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, also plans to discuss her own strategy for reopening Kansas's nonessential businesses. The meeting comes a day before Trump is scheduled to leave Washington and visit Michigan for the first time since the pandemic began, where he will participate in a tour of a Ford plant that is manufacturing ventilators.
