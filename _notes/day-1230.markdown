1. **Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military to crush uprisings around the country if governors fail to do so themselves**. "We are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now," Trump announced from a podium in the Rose Garden as sirens wailed and flash-bang grenades popped across the street. "If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them." Trump does have the legal authority to deploy active-duty military personnel to quell the protests, but governors and Pentagon officials have pushed back against or criticized the move.

2. **Protesters in Washington, D.C. were tear gassed and hit with flash-bang grenades so Trump could have his picture taken holding a Bible at a battered church just beyond the gates of the White House.** St. John's, also known as the Church of the Presidents, was briefly set on fire by protesters on Sunday. Hope Hicks devised a plan to have Trump walk over to the building for a photo op. After Trump finished giving a speech in the Rose Garden, during which he threatened to use the U.S. military to quell protests in states around the country, the protesters outside the White House were gassed and dispersed by local police and National Guardsmen so Trump could walk over to the church and take the photo. The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington said Trump "did not pray. He did not mention George Floyd, he did not mention the agony of people who have been subjected to this kind of horrific expression of racism and white supremacy for hundreds of years. We need a president who can unify and heal. He has done the opposite of that, and we are left to pick up the pieces."

3. **Dr. Anthony Fauci has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks**. The last time the two interacted was on May 18, when Trump asked Fauci to provide medical context during a call with U.S. governors. As of Monday, more than 1.7 million Americans have contracted COVID-19 and at least 104,300 have died from it, according to Johns Hopkins University.
