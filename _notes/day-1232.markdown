1. **Former Defense Secretary James Mattis defended the George Floyd protests and said Trump's threats to unleash the U.S. military against Americans makes "a mockery of our Constitution."** In a statement, Mattis said Trump "is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American peopleâ€”does not even pretend to try." Instead, the statement reads, "he tries to divide us." Mattis also rejected Defense Secretary Mark Esper's reference to American streets as a "battlespace" to be dominated, and instead said the federal government should use the military "only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors." Trump responded on Twitter: "Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about."
