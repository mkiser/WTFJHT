1. **Former Defense Secretary James Mattis defended the George Floyd protests and said Trump's threats to unleash the U.S. military against Americans makes "a mockery of our Constitution."** In a statement, Mattis said Trump "is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try." Instead, the statement reads, "he tries to divide us." Mattis also rejected Defense Secretary Mark Esper's reference to American streets as a "battlespace" to be dominated, and instead said the federal government should use the military "only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors." Trump responded on Twitter: "Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about."
