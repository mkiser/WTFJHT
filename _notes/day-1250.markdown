1. **Trump admitted that he instructed members of his administration to "slow down" coronavirus testing in order to reduce the number of confirmed cases in the U.S.** During his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump complained that increased testing for the virus is a "double-edged sword" because when you do more tests, "you’re going to find more people. You're going to find more cases!" Trump added: "So I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down, please!'" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro later claimed Trump was simply being "tongue in cheek" when he made the remark and said that it was simply "a light moment for him at a rally."  Trump has bemoaned the increases in testing across the U.S. on several occasions, including the time he suggested that if the U.S. did "very little testing, we wouldn't have the most cases," and that "by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad."

2. **The Trump administration has yet to distribute up to $14 billion in funding authorized by Congress for coronavirus testing and contact tracing.** Top Democrats sent a letter to Heath and Human Services secretary Alex Azar demanding to know why the administration has "still failed" to distribute more than $8 billion of the $25 billion Congress set aside in April to expand testing and contact tracing. The letter calls on the White House to "immediately disburse the remainder of the $25 billion in funds to ramp up testing and contact tracing capacity," including up to $2 billion meant to ensure testing is available to uninsured Americans.

3. **Trump's reelection campaign claimed that 12,000 people attended his rally in Tulsa over the weekend, but the Tulsa Fire Department says fewer than 6,200 actually showed up.** Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh claimed in a tweet that 12,000 people "made it past protesters" and into the more than 19,000-seat BOK Center. Even if that number were correct — and it's not — it would still be far lower than the tens of thousands of people the campaign expected to show up on Saturday. Trump was reportedly "furious" about the "underwhelming" crowd size at the rally and yelled at his staff backstage when he saw thousands of empty seats and space throughout the arena.

4. **Trump claimed on Twitter that the 2020 election will be "RIGGED" by "FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS"** who he says will print "MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS" to throw off the official vote counts. He added that "IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!"
