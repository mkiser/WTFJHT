1. **A record 4.5 million Americans lost health insurance between February and May. More adults have lost coverage due to job losses during that three-month period than in any one-year period in history.** The study was conducted by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families U.S.A. It found that the estimated increase in uninsured laid-off workers over the three-month period was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase during the 2009 recession when 3.9 million people lost insurance. "This is the worst economic downturn since World War II," said the author of the study. "It dwarfs the Great Recession."

3. **The Trump administration is considering sending the National Guard to hospitals to help with data collection about coronavirus patients, supply, and capacity**, according to draft letters, internal emails and officials familiar with the plans. Hospital industry leaders say any data collection problems lie primarily with the Department of Health and Human Services and the constantly-changing federal instructions. A senior administration official said the latest version of the letter to governors has "changed significantly" and governors will now be given a choice of ways they can bolster hospital data reporting if that is necessary.

4. **A New York judge lifted the temporary restraining order that was preventing Mary Trump from publicly discussing her tell-all book about her uncle Donald Trump**. The book is scheduled to be released today. The order did not apply to the book's publisher, Simon & Schuster, which planned to go ahead with publication regardless of the lawsuit. The judge's decision simply allows Mary Trump to do interviews promoting the book. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/mary-trump-restraining-order-29a423b5-afdc-453e-811b-40a8f0dee625.html))
