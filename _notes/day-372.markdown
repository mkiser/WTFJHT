1. **Trump tried to fire Robert Mueller in June, but backed down after Don McGahn threatened to quit if Trump went through with it.** After receiving the order from Trump, McGahn refused to ask the Justice Department to  fire Mueller and said he would resign instead. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-moved-to-fire-mueller-in-june-bringing-white-house-counsel-to-the-brink-of-leaving/2018/01/25/9184a49e-0238-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html?utm_term=.3a2d7d44c963))

2. **In the months that followed, Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied that Trump ever considered firing Mueller.** CNN put together a list of eight times since June 2017 that Trump and his team have claimed that Mueller's job was never on the chopping block.

3. **Trump's attorney, John Dowd, says he is the one who will decide if the President will sit down with Mueller.** Dowd's statement comes a day after Trump claimed he would be glad to speak with Mueller and would do so under oath.

4. **Mueller's investigation appears to be moving at a much faster pace than many observers previously thought**, and he is apparently on the verge of wrapping up the part of the investigation that deals with possible obstruction of justice. Even if Mueller concludes the obstruction probe, other elements of the investigation are likely to continue for several more months.

5. **Trump says he would be willing to publicly apologize for retweeting three anti-Islamic videos** posted by a leader of Britain First, one of the U.K.'s far-right groups. Trump said Thursday that he didn't know who the group was and that he didn't want to cause any difficulty. "If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people," Trump said, "I would certainly apologize if you'd like me to do that."
