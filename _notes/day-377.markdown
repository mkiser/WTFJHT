1. **Trump signed an executive order to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open** prior to the start of his first State of the Union address. During the speech, Trump also reiterated the Bush-era notion that suspected terrorists should be treated as "unlawful enemy combatants" instead of criminals. The majority of detainees held in the controversial facility [were never actually charged with a crime](https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2017/03/30/guantanamo-facts-and-figures). Of the 41 detainees that remain at Guantanamo, only seven are facing any formal charges. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/trump-signs-executive-order-to-keep-guantanamo-bay-prison-open.html))
