1. **At least 12 states have signaled that they plan to sue the Trump administration over the proposed addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census**. New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman says he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from including the question on the next census. Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington have all said they will join the suit. California has filed a separate suit. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/census-citizenship-question.html))

2. **An apparent wave of online opposition against Robert Mueller followed Trump's recent condemnation of the Russia probe where he called out Mueller by name for the first time**. Stories critical of Mueller have appeared on right-wing websites and forums, and a barrage of critical tweets and videos have started circulating on social media. “It looks like the beginnings of a campaign,” a source familiar with Trump’s legal strategy told Politico. “It looks like they are trying to seed the ground. Ultimately if the president determines he wants to fire Mueller he’s going to want to make sure there’s ample public record that he can fall back on.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/28/trump-mueller-russia-probe-488695))

3. **Trump secured a bilateral trade deal with South Korea ahead of nuclear talks with North Korea**. The deal is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday. It opens South Korea's markets to American automobiles by lifting restrictions on American manufactures like Ford and General Motors. It also extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts the amount of steel the South can can export to the United States by nearly a third.

4. **Mueller's office is asking for jail time for Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to special prosecutors and the FBI**. The special counsel's office didn't say how much jail time van der Zwaan should receive, but it did push back against van der Zwaan's argument that he should receive no jail time at all. Earlier court filings show he faces up to six months behind bars. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/robert-mueller-van-der-zwaan?utm_term=.btl1D9QMNQ#.qnBJjQ2032))
