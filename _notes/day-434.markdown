1. **The Department of Housing and Urban Development is attempting to reverse federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws**. Under Ben Carson, HUD has been freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses while sidelining officials who have attempted to pursue civil rights cases. The goal is to roll back the Obama administration's efforts to reverse racial, ethnic, and income segregation in housing and development projects subsidized by the federal government. The move comes despite the fact that the agency now has more leverage and funding than ever thanks to block grants it received in the wake of the hurricanes last year that hit the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico.

2. **White House physician Ronny Jackson got the job as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in part due to his performance at a press conference where he extolled Trump's physical and cognitive fitness**. A White House official says Trump liked the way Jackson handled the reporters' questions, so Trump nominated him to replace David Shulkin as VA Secretary.

3. **Trump tweeted pictures of a construction project from 2009 and implied that they were photos of "the start of our Southern Border WALL."**  The photos were from an ongoing project to replace sections of an existing portion of a border wall in California, but Trump's tweet made it seem like they were taken during his recent trip to the border.

4. **Mike Pence's hometown is throwing a gay pride parade next month.** A high school student who is hosting the parade told CNN that just because Pence is "openly anti-LGBT, it doesn't mean that the rest of us in his hometown are." A spokeswoman for Pence says he supports the young activist's efforts. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/28/politics/mike-pence-hometown-gay-pride/index.html))
