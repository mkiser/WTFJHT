The complaint, filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), alleges that the Trump campaign, along with Bolton's super PAC and its former chairman Steve Bannon, were aware of  Cambridge Analytica's attempts to affect the 2016 presidential election and worked in concert with the organization, a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.

3. **Trump told White House aides not to publicly discuss a plan to provide new U.S. weapons to Ukraine** to help the country fight back against Russian-backed separatists.

4. **EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt leased a Washington, D.C. apartment owned by a lobbyist for just $50 a night** â€” and he only had to pay the fee on nights when he actually slept at the one-bedroom apartment.

5. **A federal judge in Brooklyn has ruled that a lawsuit seeking to preserve DACA can continue, citing Trump's "racially charged language."** The order is the strongest signal of judicial support for DACA from the courts to date. The order, which rejected a motion to dismiss the case, says that Trump's "racial slurs" and "epithets" as a candidate and as president are enough to warrant a "plausible inference" that the decision to end DACA would be a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.
