2. **Trump took to Twitter over the weekend to rail against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program**, known as DACA. "NO MORE DACA DEAL," he tweeted just hours after tweeting "HAPPY EASTER." He also claimed that "A lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA," even though the program is only available to people who have lived in the U.S. since 2007.

3. **Former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin on Sunday said he didn't resign his position**, as the White House previously claimed. Shulkin said he was never asked to submit a letter of resignation and again claimed that he was undermined by parts of the Trump administration that wanted to privatize the VA.

4. **Scott Pruitt's daughter also stayed in the Capitol Hill condo Pruitt rented from a Washington lobbyist for several months in 2017 at just $50 per night**. Pruitt was only required to pay rent for the nights he actually stayed in the condo. Ethics officials at the EPA signed off on the arrangement, which allowed Pruitt to pay roughly $2150 less than other tenants would have paid during the same five-and-a-half-month stay.

5. **The Kremlin claims Trump invited Putin to visit the White House.** An aide to Putin told reporters on Monday that Trump spoke with Putin on March 20 and "suggested that the first meeting \[between the two\] could be held in Washington." A senior official reportedly did "not deny" that Trump raised the prospect of a White House summit, but noted that "no planning has begun as yet."

6. **Trump defended Sinclair Broadcasting after [a video went viral](https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/980175772206993409) showing dozens of local news anchors forced to read the same script** warning against "the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories" that have been plaguing the country. Trump tweeted: "So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke."

7. **Dozens of schools are closed due to massive teacher strikes in Kentucky and Oklahoma**. Teachers in Kentucky have packed the state capitol building and are decrying the "bait-and-switch" changes to their pensions that lawmakers tucked inside a different bill about sewage. Oklahoma teachers are calling for higher wages for teachers and support staff, which has dropped by 28 percent in the last ten years.
