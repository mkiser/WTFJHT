3. **Mueller's investigation is also asking more questions about a private consulting firm that has contracts with the United Arab Emirates**, suggesting that Mueller is more deeply interested in foreign influence on Washington.

4. **Scott Pruitt used an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act in early March to give substantial raises to two of his closest aides**.

5. **Trump's lawyers have asked a federal judge to force the dispute over an alleged "hush agreement" with Stormy Daniels into arbitration**. Requiring the two parties to resolve the dispute through arbitration would reduce the public exposure of the case. Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, has argued that a judge should decide the issue instead of an arbiter because the validity of agreement itself is in dispute.
