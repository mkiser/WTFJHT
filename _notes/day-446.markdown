2. **Robert Mueller is investigating a $150,000 donation to the Trump Organization in 2015 from Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk**. The donation by the Ukrainian steel magnate was made in return for a 20-minute appearance by Trump during the campaign, and is being investigated as part of Mueller's efforts to examine the streams of foreign money given to Trump and his associates prior to the election.

3. **The EPA's chief of staff said that he was responsible for the substantial pay raises given to two of Scott Pruitt's top aides, not Pruitt**. Ryan Jackson also said that the pay raises had been reversed.

4. **Lou Dobbs went after Robert Mueller on "Lou Dobbs Tonight" and urged Trump to fire the special counsel** in response to the raid on the offices of Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen. "This is now a man that has to be brought under control, it would seem to me," Dobbs said on Monday night. "Frankly, I can’t imagine ― because each of us has to come to terms with our own heart and conscience ― I would fire the SOB in three seconds if it were me."
