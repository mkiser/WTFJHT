1. **Trump tweeted his plans to launch a missile attack against Syria**. He also taunted Russia for threatening to shoot down any incoming strikes. “Get ready Russia," Trump tweeted, "because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-missiles-will-be-coming-to-syria-taunts-russia-for-vowing-to-block-them/2018/04/11/7dc52fa0-3d7a-11e8-8d53-eba0ed2371cc_story.html?utm_term=.aa150ee62b99))

2. **Trump told advisers in December that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller.** Trump was furious over reports that the subpoenas coming from Mueller's probe were targeting his business dealings with Deutsche Bank, which suggested that the investigation had expanded beyond the "red line" Trump set last year. Trump's lawyers and advisers later informed Trump that the reports about the probe were based on erroneous news reports.

3. **Trump is considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein** in the wake of the FBI raid on Michael Cohen's office. Firing Rosenstein is one of many options Trump is weighing as he attempts to find new ways to limit Robert Mueller's investigation.

4. **Michael Cohen said the FBI was "extremely professional, courteous and respectful" during the raids on his home, office, and hotel**. "I am unhappy to have my personal residence and office raided," Cohen said. "But I will tell you that members of the FBI that conducted the search and seizure were all extremely professional, courteous and respectful. And I thanked them at the conclusion."

5. **Trump and his lawyers are "less inclined" to sit down for an interview with Robert Mueller after the raid on Trump's personal attorney**. Sources say Trump is "understandably less trusting" of Mueller and his team of investigators in the wake of the raid on Michael Cohen. On Monday, Trump said the special counsel's team was the most "conflicted group of people I have ever seen."

6. **House Speaker Paul Ryan will not seek re-election** after serving nearly 20 years in Congress. Ryan will retire at the end of his term in January, and says he wants to spend more time with his family. “I have accomplished much of what I came here to do," Ryan said, "and my kids aren’t getting any younger."

7. **A group of lawmakers will introduce legislation to protect the office of the special counsel** in the event that Trump attempts to fire Robert Mueller. Four bipartisan senators plan to merge two proposals that would protect the special counsel and only allow him to be fired "for good cause" by a senior official in the Justice Department.
