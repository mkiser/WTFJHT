1. **Trump will pardon Scooter Libby, who served as the former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney** during the George W. Bush administration. Trump has already signed off on the pardon for Libby, who was convicted in 2007 of lying to the FBI and obstructing an investigation into the leak of a covert CIA operative's identity.

2. **Trump's allies are worried that the FBI may have seized recordings of conversations between Michael Cohen and his associates**. “We heard he had some proclivity to make tapes,” said one Trump adviser. “Now we are wondering, who did he tape?" Cohen is known to record some of his conversations, and he spent more than a decade as Trump's personal attorney.

3. **Mueller's office and Trump's legal team consider the likelihood of a presidential interview to be low**, and both teams are moving forward strategies that assume the interview will not happen.
