2. **Ryan Zinke repeatedly refers to himself as a geologist, even though he has never held a job as a geologist**.

3. **A broadband advisor chosen by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was arrested last week and charged with fraud** for tricking investors into pouring more than $250 million into an Alaska-based fiber optic cable company.

4. **Roughly 7 in 10 Americans support tougher U.S. sanctions on Russia**, while nearly half say Trump has done "too little" to address Russia's alleged violations of international law.
