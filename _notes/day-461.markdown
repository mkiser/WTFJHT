1. **A third federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to shut down DACA**. U.S. District Court Judge John Bates said the government's argument for ending the program was too flimsy and unpersuasive. "DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious," Bates said, "because the Department \[of Homeland Security\] failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful." Bates continued: "Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program." Bates is the first Republican appointee to rule against the move to end DACA. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/24/third-judge-rules-against-trump-daca-550092))

2. **Ronny Jackson got drunk and banged on the hotel room of a female coworker in 2015 during a trip overseas**. The 2015 incident was so disruptive that the Secret Service had to step in and calm Jackson down so he wouldn't wake up President Obama. The incident is just one of many drunken incidents involving Jackson during overseas trips. Jackson is currently being considered as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

3. **Don Blankenship is running for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia while living in a $2.4 million villa in Nevada**. Blankenship also leans hard on America First-style economic and campaign branding, despite expressing admiration for China's state-controlled economy and interest in obtaining Chinese citizenship for himself. Blankenship is mostly known for spending a year in prison for his involvement in a coal mining explosion that killed 29 people during his time as a coal mining executive. Blankenship is currently running for Senate as a champion of miners and using ads to dispute the settled facts regarding his role in the explosion.

4. **Mick Mulvaney revealed that he would only meet with lobbyists who contributed to his campaign during his time as a Congressman**. "If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you," Mulvaney explained. "If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you." The interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also urged banking industry executives on Tuesday to pressure lawmakers into supporting legislative changes that he has requested and said that trying to sway lawmakers was one of the "fundamental underpinnings of our representative democracy. And you have to continue to do it." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/mulvaney-consumer-financial-protection-bureau.html))
