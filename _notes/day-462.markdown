1. **Michael Cohen will plead the Fifth Amendment in the lawsuit filed against Trump by Stormy Daniels**. The move will allow Cohen to avoid being deposed and potentially revealing information about the criminal investigation into hush money payments Cohen made or helped to arrange for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. “I will assert my 5th Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the F.B.I. and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,” Cohen said. “The mob takes the Fifth,” Trump said during his presidential campaign. “If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/nyregion/michael-cohen-stormy-daniels.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/25/trumps-past-comments-about-pleading-the-fifth-look-pretty-ominous-now/?utm_term=.1a20269e9638))

2. **Trump admitted that Michael Cohen represented him in the "crazy Stormy Daniels deal.**" The admission marks the first time Trump has acknowledged that Cohen represented him as part of a hush-money payment to Daniels. Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, said the statement by Trump is a "hugely damaging admission" that he plans to use in his case against Trump and Cohen. "Another gift from the heavens in this case," said Avenatti. "They keep coming. I don’t know how I've fallen into such good luck in this case, but I'm going to take it."

3. **Trump will personally review documents related to Cohen's case in order to prevent prosecutors or the FBI from seeing privileged information**. Trump told the federal judge overseeing the Cohen investigation that wants to review records seized earlier this month during raids on Cohen's home, office, and hotel. The judge already ruled against Trump and Cohen's original request, but she did say that she would be willing to consider their request to have a third party review the records before prosecutors or the FBI do.

4. **Trump confirmed that he stayed overnight at a hotel in 2013 during a trip to Moscow**. Trump's admission contradicts statements that James Comey said Trump made to him on two separate occasions, in which Trump claimed he never stayed the night during the trip. Comey documented the two previous statements in his memos, which were released last week. Flight records have also confirmed that Trump stayed overnight at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow.

5. **One of the lobbyists closest to Trump is working for an ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad**. Brian Ballard's firm, Ballard Partners, disclosed last month that it was working with a trading company based in Dubai called ASM International General Trading LLC. ASM is affiliated with a member of Syria's wealthy Foz family, which has close ties to the Assad government. "We’re going to do more due diligence,” Ballard said. "We’re not the CIA, but if it were to turn out that there was any connection at all, we would withdraw from our representation of the Dubai trading company." Ballard's firm also represents an anti-Assad group. ([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-trump-fundraiser-caught-working-for-assad-ally))

6. **Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration to become the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs** amid mounting allegations about professional misconduct and other issues. Jackson denied the allegations and said they were "completely false and fabricated." He continued: "If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years."
