1. **North and South Korea agreed to end their seven-decade war**. The two neighboring countries signed an agreement to end the war during an historic meeting between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in. The deal also includes promises from both leaders to pursue "complete denuclearization" of the Korean Penninsula. Trump hailed the peace effort on Twitter, saying "KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!"

2. **Longtime NBC News correspondent Linda Vester accused Tom Brokaw of sexually harassing her in the 1990s**. Vester says Brokaw tried to kiss her on two separate occasions, groped her in an NBC conference room, and once came to her hotel room uninvited. Vester's contemporaneous journal entries and two of her friends have corroborated her allegations. Brokaw denied the allegations. "I met with Linda Vester on two occasions," he said, "both at her request, 23 years ago because she wanted advice with respect to her career at NBC." Brokaw continued: "The meetings were brief, cordial and appropriate, and despite Linda’s allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her at that time or any other."

3. **The House Intelligence Committee released a 253-page report on their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election**. Republicans have signaled that the investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but it did find evidence that Russia interfered in the election. [The redacted version of the report](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hpsci_-_declassified_committee_report_redacted_final_redacted.pdf) has been endorsed by Republican members of the panel.

4. **A new batch of text messages between FBI special agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page reveal their immediate reactions to Trump's decision to fire James Comey**, as well as the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. The texts were provided to Congress on Thursday. Some of them are cryptic or use shorthand, and are expected to draw fresh questions and criticism from Republicans who point to the previous texts between Strzok and Page as evidence of political bias against Trump within the FBI and Justice Department.

5. **An investigation into Joy-Ann Reid's claims that her old blogs were hacked to make her appear homophobic has failed to produce sufficient evidence to support Reid's claims**. Jonathan Nichols, a cybersecurity expert hired by Reid, claimed the blog posts in question did not appear in the Internet Archive when, in fact, they do. Reid's attorney announced on Wednesday that the FBI had opened an investigation into "potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts, belonging to Joy-Ann Reid."

6. **Federal prosecutors seized as many as 16 cell phones during the raids on Michael Cohen's office, home, and hotel room**. Prosecutor Thomas McKay told a judge on Thursday that he intends to hand over the seized materials to Cohen's attorneys by May 11. McKay also said investigators have already handed over the contents of four phones and one iPad, but they have "about a dozen" left. Two of the phones are BlackBerry devices, which means Cohen likely kept them in his possession for several years.

7. **Scores of vacant positions in the Trump administration are causing problems for the federal government**. The number of unfilled positions is at an all-time high, ranging from low-level appointments to the secretary's office at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The staff shortages have halted pay raises for thousands of federal workers, stalled legislation to help home buyers with their mortgages, and prevented the IRS from pushing out regulations related to the new tax law.

8. **Secretly recorded audio tapes captured House minority whip Steny Hoyer pressuring a progressive candidate named Levi Tillemann to drop out of the Colorado congressional race**. Hoyer can be heard urging Tillemann to withdraw and throw his support  behind Jason Crow, a corporate lawyer at a large Colorado law firm and the DCCC's pick to run against Republican incumbent Mike Coffman. Hoyer explains to Tillemann that the decision to support Crow was made long ago, and that this is how the party does things all across the country. “Yeah, I’m for Crow,” Hoyer says. “I am for Crow because a judgment was made very early on."
