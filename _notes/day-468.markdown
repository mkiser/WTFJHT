1. **Dr. Harold Bornstein admitted that Trump dictated the glowing 2015 letter about Trump's health.** "He dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter," Bornstein said. "I just made it up as I went along." The letter claimed, among other things, that Trump's "physical strength and stamina are extraordinary." The letter also said, using language that was curiously similar to the style of speech used by the president, that if Trump was elected, "I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."

2. **Robert Mueller warned Trump's legal team that he has the authority to subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if Trump refuses to speak to federal investigators** involved in the Russia probe. The warning came during a tense meeting in March after Trump's attorneys insisted Trump was under no obligation to speak with investigators. The move to subpoena a sitting president by a special prosecutor has never actually been tested. Unlike an interview with the special counsel, Trump would not be allowed to bring his lawyers to a grand jury hearing.

3. **Trump's current team of attorneys lacks the proper security clearance required to discuss sensitive issues that will likely be discussed during a potential presidential sit-down with Mueller**. Trump's former attorney John Dowd was the only person on Trump's legal team with the proper clearance, and he resigned in March. If Trump agrees to an interview with Mueller, his attorneys would not have the clearance required to discuss certain matters related to the meeting between Trump and Russian officials the day after Trump fired James Comey.

4. **Mueller's office wants to wait two more months before sentencing Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn**. Flynn is cooperating with Mueller's team in the Russia probe after pleading guilty to lying to investigators. "Due to the status of the special counsel's investigation," Mueller's team told the court, "the parties do not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time."
