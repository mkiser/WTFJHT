1. **Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo says it's clear that Robert Mueller's team is "still really focused on Russia collusion."** Caputo also said Mueller's team knows "more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there." Caputo was interviewed this week behind closed doors by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/politics/michael-caputo-mueller-investigator/index.html))

2. **Rudy Giuliani admitted that Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for the $130,000 hush payment to Stormy Daniels**. Giuliani said Trump repaid Cohen via a series of payments made over the course of several months until the transactions were completed either in 2017 or early 2018. "The president repaid it," Giuliani told Sean Hannity. Contrary to Trump's previous statements, Giuliani said Trump "didnâ€™t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this with my clients."

3. **Trump has all but decided to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal**. Two White House officials and a third source say the administration wants to withdraw from the deal on May 12, and the only question that remains is how Trump will go about it. There is still a chance that the U.S. will remain a party to the deal by taking actions that do not amount to "a full pullout," but the source was unable to describe what that might look like.
