1. **Michael Cohen's $600,000 deal with AT&T included providing advice to the telecom giant about the company's proposed merger with Time Warner**. Trump had voiced opposition to the $85 billion merger on the campaign trail, and his administration ultimately opposed the deal. While he was being paid to advise AT&T, Cohen was also being paid to advise other companies on a wide range of issues.

3. **Rudy Giuliani's law firm undercut his recent statements defending the president after Giuliani abruptly resigned from the firm earlier this week**. Giuliani said payments made to silence porn stars were commonplace at his firm, even if the client doesn't know about it. A spokeswoman for the firm responded and said, “Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-resigns-law-firm-greenberg-traurig.html))

4. **John Kelly said he's never seriously considered leaving his job as Trump's chief of staff.** Kelly suggested that he remains in lock-step with Trump on several issues, and that they spend up to eight hours a day together and have a close relationship. "In retrospect, I wish I had been here from day one," Kelly said. "I think in some cases in terms of staffing or serving the president that first six months was pretty chaotic and there were people some people hired that maybe shouldn't have."
