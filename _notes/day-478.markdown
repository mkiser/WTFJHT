1. **New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after four women accused him of physically assaulting them**. Schneiderman positioned himself as a public champion of women's rights and an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement, but four women have come forward alleging that he subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. The women claim that he frequently hit them after drinking, often in bed and never with their consent. Two of the women say Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. Schneiderman resigned three hours after the allegations were made public.

2. **Robert Mueller rejected Trump's request to allow him to answer questions from investigators in writing**. Trump's legal team has been pushing for Mueller to allow him to submit written answers to Mueller's questions, because they're afraid that Trump might lie to or mislead investigators during an in-person interview. Rudy Giuliani has said that Trump will fight a potential subpoena for him to testify in front of a grand jury, but has stopped short of saying that Trump would go as far as to ignore a subpoena from the special counsel.

3. **Senior White House staff are urging Trump to fire EPA chief Scott Pruitt**. Pruitt is currently the subject of 11 federal investigations, and even some Republicans are calling for his resignation. Trump has championed Pruitt up to this point, but support from the president appears to be waning as Pruitt's mounting legal and ethical issues continue to pile up.

4. **Trump is getting frustrated with Giuliani's apparently inability to handle the situation involving the hush payment to Stormy Daniels**. Trump is concerned that Giuliani's media appearances are raising more questions than they are answering. Some aides say they expect Trump to fire Giuliani if he is unable to turn things around soon.

5. **A  booklet published as part of Melania Trump's new "Be Best" campaign for online child safety appears to have been plagiarized from a document released during the Obama administration**. Aside from the introductory page, the entire "Talking with Kids about Being Online" booklet is virtually identical to the "Net Cetera" booklet published by the FTC under Obama. The website's language was later updated from "a booklet by First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission" to "a Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump."
