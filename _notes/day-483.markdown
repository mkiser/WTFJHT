1. **Trump referred to undocumented immigrants as "animals" during a White House meeting**. "These aren’t people," Trump said. "These are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before." Trump also suggested that the mayor of Oakland, California should be charged with obstruction of justice for warning her constituents about ICE raids in February. "You talk about obstruction of justice," said Trump. "I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of Oakland."

2. **The unnamed law enforcement official who leaked confidential financial records about Michael Cohen and his shell company last week did so because the official was worried that information was being withheld from law enforcement**. Two suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by Cohen's bank were missing from the database managed by the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN). “I have never seen something pulled off the system," the official said. "That system is a safeguard for the bank. It’s a stockpile of information. When something’s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.” The official continued: “That’s why I came forward.” ([New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records))

3. **Michael Cohen solicited a payment of at least $1 million from the Qatari government in late 2016**. Cohen offered to provide access and advice about the then-incoming Trump administration in exchange for the money. Qatar declined the offer, which came in the wake of a Dec. 12, 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Qatar's foreign minister and Michael Flynn. Cohen didn't attend the meeting but he did speak separately to Ahmed al-­Rumaihi, who was head of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund at the time.

4. **Christopher Wylie claimed that Cambridge Analytica offered services that were intended to discourage voting and suppress voter turnout for targeted sections of the American population**. Wylie didn't provide any specifics about the voter suppression services offered by Cambridge Analytica during his Congressional testimony on Wednesday, but he did allege that African-American communities were particular targets of the company's "voter disengagement tactics." He also said that political actions committees requested such voter suppression services from Cambridge Analytica.
