1. **Paul Manafort's former son-in-law cut a plea deal with the Justice Department and has agreed to cooperate with investigators** on two other criminal probes. Jeffrey Yohai's guilty plea agreement is under seal, so there are very few available details about the agreement. But a federal prosecutor had been overseeing an investigation into Yohai's real estate and bank dealings in California and New York starting in early 2017.

2. **A new Trump administration rule will withhold federal funding for clinics that provide abortions or refer patients to places that perform them**.

3. **Giuliani says Robert Mueller has agreed to limit the scope of his potential interview with Trump to two topics instead of five**.
