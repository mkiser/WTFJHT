1. **Trump dictated Donald Trump Jr.'s statement about his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign.** Trump and his advisers agreed that their strategy should be for Trump Jr. to release a statement in order to get out in front of the story. The claims made in the statement were later shown to be misleading. Trump's decision to intervene in his son's response had not previously been reported, and the revelation could put him and some members of his family in legal jeopardy.

2. **Trump's lawyers sent a 20-page letter to the special counsel's office arguing that it's impossible for the president to obstruct any aspect of the Russia investigation.** The letter claims that Trump can't possibly obstruct justice because the U.S. Constitution empowers the president to, "if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon."

3. **Giuliani bragged that Trump could have shot James Comey in the Oval Office and he still wouldn't face an indictment for it.** "In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted," Giuliani said. "I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is." Giuliani claimed that the only way Trump could be indicted is if he is impeached first. "If he shot James Comey, he’d be impeached the next day," Giuliani said. "Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him."

4. **Giuliani said it is "unthinkable" that Trump would pardon himself if he is convicted of a crime.** When asked if Trump had the power to do so, Giuliani said, "He probably does." He continued: "He has no intention of pardoning himself, but he probably — not to say he can’t."

5. **Trump will host this year's Ramadan dinner at the White House next week.** The iftar dinner, as it is called, is scheduled for next Wednesday. Trump faced criticism for breaking with decades of tradition by failing to host the dinner last year. The attendee list for this year's dinner has not yet been released.
