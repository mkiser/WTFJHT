1. **Mueller's team accused Paul Manafort of felony witness tampering in his federal tax and money laundering case.** As a result, federal prosecutors asked a judge to revise Manafort's terms of release while he awaits trial. Prosecutors say Manafort attempted to contact witnesses by phone through an intermediary and through an encrypted messaging program in order to "suborn perjury," also known as trying to convince someone to lie under oath.

2. **Trump blamed Jeff Sessions for the ongoing Russia investigation and suggested that Sessions could have shut the probe down by now if he hadn't recused himself.** "The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself," Trump tweeted. "I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!"

3. **Vladimir Putin said during an interview on Austrian TV that he and Trump have a close working relationship and "regularly talk over the phone."** When asked why there has not been a bilateral summit between Putin and the Trump administration, Putin said "this is the result of the ongoing acute political struggle in the United States." Putin continued: "Indeed, Donald Trump and I have, firstly, met more than once at various international venues and secondly, we regularly talk over the phone."

4. **Hundreds of migrant children have spent more than the legal maximum of 72 hours in custody at U.S. border stations.** Border agents and child welfare workers are running out of space to keep the children who have been separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy. As of Sunday, nearly 300 of the 550 children currently in custody have exceeded the time limit for immigrants of any age to be detained in government facilities – almost half of them are under the age of 12.
