1. **Giuliani claimed Mueller's team is "trying very hard to frame \[Trump\] to get him in trouble when he hasn't done anything wrong."** Giuliani made the comments at the Globes capital market conference in Tel Aviv. He also reiterated the claim that Trump has the power to pardon himself, but won't do so because he is innocent. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/13219b17364444fd9509ef6499ac093f))

2. **Mexico imposed new tariffs on roughly $3 billion worth of American pork, steel, cheese, and other goods in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.** The move represents an escalation in Trump's ongoing trade war with Mexico, Canada, and U.S. allies in Europe. The move also complicates the Trump administration's attempts to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that Trump's "preference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately."

3. **After meeting with Kim Kardashian last week to discuss Johnson's case, Trump commuted Alice Marie Johnson's life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime.** A White House official said Trump is "obsessed" with his power to pardon people, describing pardons as Trump's new "favorite thing" to talk about. The official also said that Trump may sign another dozen or more pardons over the next two months.

4. **More than 118,000 California primary voters were left off the voter rolls due to a random printing error.** Those voters can still cast provisional ballots, but the process of counting and verifying a large number of provisional ballots could delay the vote tally in some local races. "We apologize for the inconvenience and concern this has caused," said the Los Angeles County Clerk in a statement. "Voters should be assured their vote will be counted."

5. **Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration policy of separating migrant children from their families** when they arrive at the U.S. southern border. "If people don’t want to be separated from their children, they should not bring them with them," Sessions told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. "We’ve got to get this message out. You’re not given immunity."

6. **Facebook has had data-sharing agreements with at least four Chinese electronics companies since 2010**, including one telecom manufacturing giant called Huawei, which has close ties to the Chinese government and was flagged by U.S. intelligence agencies as a national security threat. The partnerships with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL are all still active, but Facebook says it plans to wind down the deal with Huawei by the end of the week.

7. **The Trump communications aide who mocked John McCain's deteriorating health has left the White House.** The White House said Kelly Sadler is "no longer employed within the executive office of the president," but two people familiar with Sadler's departure said she was not ousted because of her comments about McCain. They suggested that Sadler was pushed out due to tensions between her and White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp, who were reportedly unable to be in the same room with each other.
