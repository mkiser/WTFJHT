5. **Sean Hannity sarcastically told witnesses in the Mueller probe to "follow Hillary Clinton's lead" by destroying their personal phones before handing them over to prosecutors.** Hannity told Mueller's witnesses to "delete all your emails and then acid-wash your emails and hard drives on the phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer to little itsy bitsy pieces." Hand them over to Robert Mueller, Hannity continued, "and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law." Hannity later insisted that he was kidding.

6. **Colin Kaepernick's attorneys are expected to seek federal subpoenas to compel testimony from Trump, Pence, and other administration officials** who are familiar with Trump's agenda on NFL protests and the national anthem. The goal is to expose Trump's political involvement with NFL owners during Kaepernick's time as a free agent and explore allegations that Trump had direct talks with owners about players kneeling during the anthem. One of Kaepernick's attorneys recently claimed that an unnamed NFL owner admitted under oath during a deposition that he decided not to offer Kaepernick a contract after Trump called for the firing of players who refused to stand for the national anthem.
