1. **Trump routinely rips up papers that need to be preserved.** He does it so much that some aides are specifically tasked with taping the papers back together.

2. **Trump withdrew his endorsement of the G7 economic agreement and accused Justin Trudeau of being "dishonest" and "weak."** The leaders of the G7 powers overcame their differences by Saturday and agreed on a joint communique expressing common economic principles and aspirations, but Trump later rejected the communique after Trudeau expressed his objections to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.

3. **Trump's economic adviser said Trump pulled out of the joint statement with G7 allies because Trudeau's "betrayal" made Trump look weak before his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.** Trump "is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around," said Larry Kudlow. "He is not going to permit any show of weakness on a trip to negotiate with North Korea."
