1. **Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy press secretary Raj Shah are planning to leave the White House.** Sanders plans to leave by the end of the year, while Shah hasn't settled on an exact date. Sanders denied on Twitter that she plans to leave: "Does @CBSNews know something I don’t about my plans and my future?
