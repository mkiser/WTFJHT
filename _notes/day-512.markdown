2. **German Chancellor Angela Merkel also hinted at an escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and European Union.** Merkel warned that Europe's strategic interests are tied to the future of the car industry shortly after Trump cited national security concerns as a reason to place tariffs on German cars. "We should think about the strategic significance of the auto industry for the European Union," Merkel said, "so we can prepare an exchange with the U.S." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-germany-merkel/competition-authorities-might-need-to-look-at-big-u-s-platforms-merkel-idUSKBN1JB12Y))

4. **Michael Cohen asked a federal judge for a gag order against Michael Avenatti in order to stop him from speaking to the media about the Stormy Daniels case.** Cohen argued that Avenatti's "publicity tour" of more that 100 television interviews since March is unethical, and harms Cohen's ability to have a fair trial by turning the case into a "media circus."

5. **Giuliani said the Mueller investigation should be suspended by the end of the day on Friday, and claimed that suspending the probe today would be Sessions and Rosenstein's last chance to "redeem themselves."** Giuliani also called for Peter Strzok to be put in jail over a series of text messages sent between Strzok and fellow FBI agent Lisa Page during the 2016 election. "Mueller should be suspended and honest people should be brought in, impartial people to investigate these people like Strzok," Giuliani said. "Strzok should be in jail by the end of next week."
