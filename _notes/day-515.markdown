1. **Top lawmakers from both parties demanded on Sunday that Trump halt his policy of separating children from their parents at the border.** Republican lawmakers, Laura Bush, a conservative newspaper, and a former Trump adviser joined with Democrats to condemn the policy that has removed nearly 2,000 children from their parents over the last six weeks. Melania Trump, meanwhile, placed the blame on "both sides," saying that she "hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together."

2. **The United Nation's top human rights official called for an immediate halt to the practice of separating children from their families at the border, condemning the practice as "government-sanctioned child abuse."** "The thought that any state would seek to deter parents by inflicting such abuse on children is unconscionable," said United Nations high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein. U.S.  Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley called al-Hussein's statement hypocritical, saying "Neither the United Nations nor anyone else will dictate how the United States upholds its borders."

3. **Peter Strzok said he would be willing to testify without immunity and without invoking the 5th Amendment before the House Judiciary Committee and any other congressional committee.** Strzok was removed from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election for sending anti-Trump texts, and his lawyer says Strzok "wants the chance to clear his name and tell his story." Strzok's lawyer added: "He thinks that his position, character and actions have all been misrepresented and caricatured, and he wants an opportunity to remedy that."

4. **Roger Stone revealed that he met with another Russian national during the 2016 campaign that he failed to disclose to congressional investigators.** Stone met with a man who said his name was Henry Greenberg in May 2016 and was offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Greenberg, who also goes by the name Henry Oknyansky, wanted Trump to pay $2 million for the dirt on Clinton. Stone eventually rejected the offer, saying "You don’t understand Donald Trump. He doesn't pay for anything." Stone later received a text from a Trump campaign communications official: "How crazy is the Russian?" Stone replied: "Wants big &$ for the info- waste of time."

* **Roger Stone’s and Michael Caputo’s damningly false denials of contact with Russians.** If Roger Stone and Michael Caputo told investigators what they said publicly, they could have real problems.
