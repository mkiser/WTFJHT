1. **Babies and other young children who show up at the border are being forcibly separated from their families and sent to one of three "tender age" shelters** in South Texas. Lawyers and medical professionals who visited the facilities describe play rooms filled with crying preschool-age children in crisis. The government is planning to open a fourth facility in Houston to house hundreds of additional migrant children. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/dc0c9a5134d14862ba7c7ad9a811160e))

2. **The cost of housing migrant children separately in Trump's newly created "tent cities" is far higher than the cost of housing them together with their parents in more permanent buildings.** It costs $256 per person per night to hold children in permanent housing facilities and $775 per person per night to house them in tent cities. The increased cost is primarily due to the need to bring in additional security, air conditioning, medical workers, and other government contractors to staff the new tent cities.

3. **Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled while eating at a Mexican restaurant by a handful protesters who chanted "Shame!" and "End family separation!"** Other diners at the restaurant applauded the protesters, who remained nonviolent. Neither Nielsen's security nor management at the restaurant tried to stop the protesters. Nielsen eventually paid her check and was escorted out of the restaurant by Secret Service agents after listening to about 15 minutes of chanting.

4. **Michael Cohen wants Trump to pay for his legal bills.** Cohen recently hired New York attorney Guy Petrillo to represent him in the federal investigation into his business practices, and he is reportedly frustrated that Trump hasn't offered to pay his legal fees.
