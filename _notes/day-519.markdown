1. **The Pentagon will house up to 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children at military bases in the coming months.** Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services asked whether beds could be made available for children at military installations "for occupancy as early as July through December 31, 2018." The sites will be ruin by HHS employees or contractors working with HHS. It remains unclear whether the children's parents will also be housed there, and neither White House or HHS officials said they could provide details on that issue.

2. **Hundreds of families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border have been reunited since May, and the Department of Homeland Security says it has stopped referring members of detained families to the Department of Justice for prosecution**. Roughly 500 of the more than 2,300 children who were separated from their parents have been reunited in over last month, but it remains unclear how many of those children are still being detained with their families. Authorities are still seeking a centralized process to reunite the remaining families. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hundreds-separated-migrant-families-reunited/story?id=56081072))

3. **Trump issued an executive order to reverse an Obama-era policy that emphasized protecting "vulnerable" marine environments, instead depicting the world's oceans as a source of expanded business opportunities.** Trump said he was "rolling back excessive bureaucracy" in order to focus on "growing the ocean economy." Trump's executive order also focuses heavily on the notion that the ocean is a resource for promoting national security, especially when it comes to "domestic energy production from federal waters."

4. **National Enquirer executives regularly sent advance digital copies of stories about Trump and his political opponents to Michael Cohen for review during the 2016 presidential campaign.** The company denies the unusual practice, but three sources say it continued even after Trump took office. If "a story specifically about Trump," one person said, "then it was sent over to Michael, and as long as there were no objections from him, the story could be published."

5. **Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was dropped by his speakers bureau** following his "[womp womp](https://youtu.be/Vrt7q6QKF5o)" comment in response to a story about a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome who had been separated from her parents at the border.
