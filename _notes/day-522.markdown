1. **Trump called for the immediate deportation of people who enter the United States illegally without any judicial process whatsoever**, likening immigrants and asylum seekers to invaders who are trying to "break into" the country. "We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country," Trump tweeted. "When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.‚Äù ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-calls-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants-with-no-judges-or-court-cases-idUSKBN1JK0OL?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNewsFBChatbot) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-advocates-depriving-undocumented-immigrants-of-due-process-rights/2018/06/24/dfa45d36-77bd-11e8-93cc-6d3beccdd7a3_story.html?utm_term=.62c65846a2b0))

2. **Previously undisclosed emails revealed that EPA chief Scott Pruitt discussed hiring a friend of the lobbyist family that owned the condominium he was renting in D.C. for $50 a night.** The new files also show communications about the lobbyist's client interests, suggesting a closer relationship between Pruitt and the lobbying agency than previously known.

3. **Pruitt is also facing another probe from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel into claims that he retaliated against a handful of EPA employees who pushed back against Pruitt's spending and management.** At least six current and former agency officials were fired or reassigned for questioning Pruitt's need for 24-hour security protection, as well as Pruitt's other questionable spending and practices. The OSC probe is the latest in the list of roughly two dozen other inquiries into Pruitt's actions as head of the EPA.

"They don't really see eye to eye," said a former senior White House official.
