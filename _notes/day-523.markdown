1. **The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third iteration of Trump's travel ban in a 5-4 ruling.** The ruling was spilt among partisan lines, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the conservative majority. The ban was issued last fall and prevents travelers from eight counties – including six majority-Muslim countries – from entering the United States. The ban was challenged by several states, which claimed that the order effectively constituted a "Muslim ban," violated Trump's executive authority and the Constitution, and harmed U.S. citizens and educational institutions.

2. **Robert Mueller is ready to accelerate his probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.** Mueller's team plans to produce its conclusions and possible indictments related to collusion by this fall. Mueller will also decide soon whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Trump attempted to obstruct justice.

3. **The commissioner of Customs and Border Protection says the agency has stopped handing migrant adults who cross the border with children over for prosecution**, which contradicts claims by other Trump administration officials that the "zero tolerance" policy is still in place. Kevin McAleenan said the agency would continue to refer single adults for prosecution, and that border agents would also separate children from adults if the child is in danger or the adult has a criminal record. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have enough detention space to accommodate the surge of families crossing the border, so it will at least temporarily revive the "catch and release" approach used under Obama.

4. **Federal officials ordered protesters occupying an ICE encampment in Portland, OR to vacate the premises or face arrest**, but officials have not provided a deadline for the eviction order of the Occupy ICE PDX demonstrators. ICE temporarily closed its Portland facility last week after protesters pitched tents on the property to protest the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward migrants coming across the border. The encampment in Portland is one of several Occupy ICE movements that have emerged recently in various cities across the country.

5. **Eight of the most influential tech companies in the country met with U.S. intelligence officials last month to discuss preparations for the upcoming midterm elections.** Company officials met with representatives from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in anticipation of a repeat of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The meeting was the first significant discussion between tech companies and intelligence officials ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

6. **Sean Spicer is developing a talk show that is tentatively named "Sean Spicer's Common Ground," in which he plans to interview notable guests in an informal setting.** No network is attached to the pilot, which shoots in July, but there are several heavy hitters from the world of unscripted television backing the project. "In this current environment," Spicer said, "I think it’s important to have a platform where we can have civil, respectful, and informative discussions on the issues of the day."
