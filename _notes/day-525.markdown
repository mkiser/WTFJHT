1. **A company controlled by Paul Manafort and his wife owed $10 million to Russian lender Oleg Deripaska.** The loan was discovered in an affidavit attached to a newly unsealed search warrant application from July 2017. The affidavit also revealed that Deripaska financially backed Manafort's consulting work in Ukraine when it began in 2005-2006. The search warrant also confirmed that Mueller has been investigating Manafort's role in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

2. **Immigrant children as young as three are being ordered to appear in court for their own deportation hearings without legal representation.** Requiring unaccompanied minors to go through deportation alone is not new, but the number of children who are affected by this process has gone up during the Trump presidency. The children are being served with notices to appear in court, but they are not entitled to an attorney. Instead, they are given a list of legal services organizations that might help them.

3. **Federal officials have launched two reviews into Trump's handling of thousands of migrant children separated from their families at the border.** The Government Accountability Office and the Health and Human Services inspector general both launched reviews Wednesday. The GAO will audit the systems and processes used to track families as they were separated, while the HHS inspector general announced that it will review the safety and health protections in the agency's shelters for migrant children.

4. **Trump's pick to head the IRS owns properties at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki and Tower in Hawaii.** Chuck Rettig had previously disclosed his 50 percent stake in a pair of Honolulu rental units, but he did not specify their location.

5. **Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Wednesday to make Puerto Rico the nation's 51st state by 2021.** The Puerto Rico Admission Act of 2018 was authored by Puerto Rico's resident commissioner, Jennifer González-Colón, a Republican nonvoting member of Congress. The bill is cosponsored by 22 Republicans and 14 Democrats, and calls for the creation of a task force of nine members of Congress to look into the changes necessary to incorporate Puerto Rico as a state.
