1. **A gunman opened fire inside the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland on Thursday, killing five people and injuring two others** before being taken into custody by police. Jarrod Ramos had a long-standing grudge against the Gazette that began in July 2011 when a columnist wrote about a criminal harassment case against him. Ramos later brought a defamation suit against the paper and lost. Neither the columnist nor the editor and publisher were still employed at the Gazette at the time of the shooting.

2. **Rep. Maxine Waters cancelled multiple events after receive what she described as a "very serious death threat" against her.** In a statement, Waters said, "There was one very serious death threat made against me on Monday from an individual in Texas which is why my planned speaking engagements in Texas and Alabama were cancelled this weekend." Waters was scheduled to speak Friday at the conference of the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women in Birmingham and another event in Texas.

3. **A former aide to Roger Stone has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury hearing evidence in the Russia investigation.** Andrew Miller was also ordered to hand over documents, an order his lawyer is attempting to quash in court. Miller worked briefly for Stone around the time of the 2016 Republican National Convention, where he helped to arrange media interviews and carried out other tasks for Stone.

4. **The U.S. government was running a "pilot program" of widespread prosecution and family separation of migrants and their children months before the official announcement of Trump's "zero tolerance" policy.** At least 1,768 children were separated from their parents between October 2016 and February 2018, in addition to the 2,342 children who were separated since May 5 â€” bringing the total number of separated kids to more than 4,100. It is unclear how many of the 1,768 children were separated after Trump's inauguration because DHS has refused to provide comprehensive data about the program.

5. **The Department of Justice is drafting a plan to completely overhaul the asylum policy for the United States.** The current version of the plan would prohibit people from getting asylum if they entered the country illegally. It would also make it extremely difficult for Central Americans to qualify for asylum, and would codify an opinion written by Jeff Sessions that restricts asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. The draft resolution is currently going through an evaluation process before it is published in the Federal Register, at which point the public will have 90 days to submit feedback.
