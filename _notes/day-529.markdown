1. **Susan Collins will not vote to confirm Trump's pick to fill Justice Robert Kennedy's vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court if the nominee has displayed "hostility" toward Roe v. Wade.** "A candidate for this important position who would overturn Roe v. Wade would not be acceptable to me," Collins said, "because that would indicate an activist agenda that I don’t want to see a judge have." Collins is considered a moderate Republican Senator, and she could end up being the deciding vote in the upcoming confirmation hearings.

* **Trump told his advisers that he's looking to replace Justice Kennedy with someone who has a demonstrable history of academic writing — he just doesn't want to actually read any of it himself.** ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/395083-trump-doesnt-intend-to-read-supreme-court-nominees-academic))

1. **Canada announced Sunday that it has imposed new tariffs on $12.5 billion worth of American exports and goods.** The new tariffs are meant to be a proportional response to Trump's recent steel and aluminum tariffs. Canada's latest taxes are based on the amount of steel and aluminum shipped last year to the United States from Canada. ([CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2018/07/01/news/canada-us-tariffs-steel-aluminum/index.html))

2. **Trump said he's not happy with the revised NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico and he won't sign it until after the midterm elections.** "NAFTA, I could sign it tomorrow, but I’m not happy with it," Trump said. "I want to make it more fair, okay? I want to wait until after the election." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/07/01/trump-says-he-wont-sign-any-nafta-deal-until-after-midterms/?utm_term=.e9c657224b54))

3. **Trump tried to pretend that he never urged House Republicans to vote for an immigration bill — even though he tweeted that exact thing just three days earlier.** He [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1013139532290625538) on Saturday: "I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold." And [here's Trump's tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1011952266268545024) from Wednesday: "HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE."

4. **Senior Border Patrol official Ronald D. Vitiello will replace Thomas D. Homan and serve as the new acting director of ICE.** Vitiello currently serves as acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, and previously served as the chief of the Border Patrol. Homan retired last month after serving as the acting head of ICE. The Senate must now approve a full-time director for ICE, and Vitiello is considered to be the leading candidate.

5. **The White House is walking back [Trump's call](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1013023608040513537) for Saudi Arabia to "increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels" per day to make up for decreases in production by Iran and Venezuela.** Trump claimed on Twitter that he had spoken to Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz and that Salman had agreed to Trump's request. The White House later issued a statement saying that, while Saudi Arabia has the capacity to increase production if necessary, the Saudis will use it "prudently" and only "if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability, and in coordination with its producer partners, to respond to any eventuality."

6. **Trump: "I hope the other side realizes that they better just take it easy."** Trump was responding to a question about the recent incidents and protests involving White House officials, including Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kirstjen Nielsen, who were either shouted at or refused service due to their involvement with the Trump White House. "They better just take it easy," Trump continued, "because some of the languages, some of the words you – even some of the radical ideas, I really think they’re very bad for the country."

7. **Podcast host John "Stuttering John" Melendez managed to trick Trump into calling into him from Air Force One by telling the White House switchboard operator that he had Sen. Bob Menendez on the line for him.** The radio shock jock and comedian claimed to represent the Democratic senator from New Jersey and said he had an urgent legislative matter to discuss. The result was [a six-minute phone conversation](http://stutteringjohnpodcast.libsyn.com/the-stuttering-john-podcast-4) between Stuttering John and the President of the United States aboard Air Force One, during which they talked about immigration and the Supreme Court. The White House has since launched an internal investigation into how the comedian was able to get through to Trump so easily.

8. **The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is launching a campaign to oppose Trump's trade tariff policies.** The business lobbying giant is using a state-by-state analysis to argue that Trump is risking a global trade war that will affect the wallets of U.S. consumers.
