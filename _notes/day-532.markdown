1. **Trump asked several top foreign policy advisers last August about the possibility of invading Venezuela.** Trump's aides, including then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster, warned against the invasion and said it could backfire. One official with knowledge of Trump's private comments said there was "no imminent plan for a military strike," and that Trump was simply thinking "out loud."

2. **Scott Pruitt directly asked Trump this spring to fire Jeff Sessions and install him as the new Attorney General in Sessions' place.** Pruitt offered to temporarily replace Sessions for 210 days under the Vacancies Reform Act, after which Pruitt would return to Oklahoma to run for office. Advisers quickly shot down Pruitt's proposal. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/politics/scott-pruitt-jeff-sessions-trump/index.html))

3. **Activists in two separate protests against Trump's immigration policies were arrested at the Statue of Liberty on Wednesday.** One group unfurled a large banner calling for the abolition of ICE, while another woman climbed the base of the statue to protest Trump's family separation policy for migrants crossing the southern border. Liberty Island was closed and roughly 4,500 tourists were forced off the island as a result of the protests, which lasted for several hours before police were able to reach the woman who climbed the statue and take her into custody.

4. **The owner of a Chinese factory says it has been hired to make flags for Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.** The factory has reportedly made flags for the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. "We also make flags for Trump for 2020," the factory owner said. "It seems like he has another campaign going on in 2020. Isn't that right?" It is unclear whether the official Trump reelection organization is the one who ordered the flags.

5. **Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians in an attempt to sweeten the Iran nuclear deal.** "Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians â€“ including to government officials," Trump tweeted. "How big (and bad) is that?" Trump provided no evidence to support his claim, and apparently based it instead on the statements of a hard-line Iranian cleric who has been very critical of the Iran deal. Three senior Obama administration officials who were intimately involved in the JCPOA negotiations pushed back on the claim.

6. **Michael Avenatti says he will run for president in 2020 if Trump seeks reelection, but only if he thinks there is no other candidate in the race who can beat Trump.** "IF (big) he seeks re-election, I will run," Avenatti tweeted, "but only if I think that there is no other candidate in the race that has a REAL chance at beating him. We can't relive 2016." Avenatti later went on CNN and hinted at a potential presidential platform that included dismantling Trump's immigration policies, improving the international standing of the U.S., and targeting unemployment in the heartland.
