1. **Trump nominated federal appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.** Kavanaugh served under Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton. Kavanaugh also worked on the 2000 Florida recount litigation that ended in a Supreme Court decision that handed George W. Bush the presidency. "What matters is not a judge's personal views," Trump said, "but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the Constitution require. I am pleased to say I have found, without doubt, such a person." Trump called Kavanaugh a judge with "impeccable credentials," and said he is "considered a judge's judge."

2. **A federal judge rejected Trump's request to alter a decades-old legal settlement that prohibits long-term detention of children who entered the U.S. illegally with their parents.** Judge Dolly M. Gee of Los Angeles called the legal reasoning behind Trump's attempt to get out from under the so-called Flores consent decree of 1997 "tortured," and said it was "a cynical attempt" to shift immigration policy. "Defendants seek to light a match to the Flores Agreement and ask this Court to upend the parties’ agreement by judicial fiat," Judge Gee said. "It is apparent that Defendants’ Application is a cynical attempt...to shift responsibility to the Judiciary for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-considered Executive action that have led to the current stalemate."

3. **Rudy Giuliani has continued to work on behalf of foreign clients both personally and through his law firm while serving as Trump's personal attorney.** Giuliani said in recent interviews that he is working with clients in Brazil and Colombia, among other countries, in addition to giving paid speeches for an Iranian dissident group. Giuliani has never registered with the Justice Department on behalf of his overseas clients, saying that it's not necessary because he does not directly lobby the U.S. government and he doesn't charge Trump for his services.

4. **During their trip to Moscow last week, an all-Republican delegation of U.S. lawmakers met with at least two Russian individuals who are currently sanctioned by the United States.** Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spoke with Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who has been sanctioned since 2014 for Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful” activities in Ukraine. The group also heard from Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Konstantin Kosachev, who complained about the latest round of U.S. sanctions against Russian individuals. Kosachev was sanctioned in April over Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and other “malign activity.” ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilytamkin/us-republican-delegation-met-with-sanctioned-russians-in?utm_term=.xdZ0NkpwRp#.mk2Gkzdved))
