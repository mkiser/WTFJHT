1. **Trump lashed out at Germany during a NATO breakfast, claiming that "Germany is a captive of Russia" because it pays "billions and billions of dollars a year" to Russia for energy.** "You tell me, is that appropriate?" He added: "Germany is totally controlled by Russia." Germany has not met its NATO spending commitments and has started construction on a second natural gas pipeline to Russia. Germany argues that it has increased its contributions to NATO and plans to spend even more on the alliance in the coming years.

2. **The Trump administration published a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that it plans to hit with an additional 10 percent tariff.** The new list expands the mounting trade war with China to include goods such as seafood, minerals, chemicals, as well as personal care items like shampoo and soap. It also includes handbags, luggage, gloves, paper, and other consumer items. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/10/trump-china-trade-tariffs-708707))

3. **Trump pardoned the two Oregon cattle ranchers who sentenced to five years in prison for committing arson on federal land — punishments which led to the armed occupation of a wildlife refuge by the Bundy family in 2016.** The pardons were the result of a months-long campaign by agricultural groups like the Oregon Cattlemen's Association and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The White House issued a statement claiming that the Obama administration had been "overzealous" in its pursuit of the cattle ranchers. "This was unjust," said Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

4. **U.S. government officials told four immigrant women that they would have to pay for DNA tests in order to be reunited with their children.** The tests are part of the Trump administration's latest effort to reunite families that it had separated at the U.S. southern border. The tests are being administered by a private contractor on behalf of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The Department of Health and Human Services has refused to name the contractor, which many constitute a violation of federal law. The Office of Refugee Resettlement denied passing on the costs of the DNA tests to the four migrant women.

5. **Some children who have been reunited with their families after being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border are unable to recognize their mothers.** Other children who had been potty-trained before being separated had regressed back to diapers.

6. **From the moment it went online in 2014, the web portal designed to keep track of unaccompanied children and process their release has experienced major technological problems.** Among the issues users have encountered are a limited number of total concurrent users, lost saved data, poor searchability, and significant manual work for minor updates and patches. That same system is now being used as a key part of the Office of Refugee Resettlement's efforts to track the thousands of migrant children who were separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration's "no tolerance policy."

7. **Pfizer announced on Tuesday that it would delay drug price increases for no more than six months after an extensive conversation between the CEO of the company and Trump.** The conversation came after Trump tweeted that Pfizer and other U.S. drug manufacturers "should be ashamed" for raising prices on some of their medications. Pfizer agreed to suspend drug price increases that went into effect on July 1 until the end of the year or until Trump's drug pricing blueprint goes into effect — whichever comes first. "We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same," Trump tweeted from Europe.
