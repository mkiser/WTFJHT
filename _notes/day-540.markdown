1. **Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold a press conference for a "law enforcement announcement"** at 11:45 a.m. ([Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/live))

2. **The White House ordered the FBI to give lawmakers more access to classified information about the informant used in 2016 to investigate possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.** The director of national intelligence and the director of the FBI have tried to keep access to the classified documents tightly limited, but the files will now be made available to all members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

3. **Jared Kushner doesn't have the necessary security clearance required to review some of the government's most sensitive  secrets.** Until late May, Kushner had nearly unfettered access to highly classified intelligence, even though he only had interim security clearance while he waited for his background check to clear. Now, he has "top secret" clearance, but that level of clearance doesn't allow him to see some of the nation's most classified intelligence, known as "sensitive compartmental information," or SCI.

4. **Trump said he won't rule out ceasing NATO military exercises in the Baltic States if Putin requested it during their upcoming meeting in Helsinki.** Joint exercises involving 17 nations, including hundreds of U.S. troops and several warships, are currently underway in the Black Sea. If Trump chooses to pull the U.S. out of the military exercises, NATO allies could still conduct them on their own, but they would likely be forced to carry them out under a different banner since the U.S. can veto labeling them as NATO exercises.

5. **Trump said he told British Prime Minister Theresa May how to negotiate the U.K.'s exit from the E.U. but she went "the opposite way."** Trump also blamed London Mayor Sadiq Khan for spiraling crime and for not standing up to terrorists, insisted that former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson would make "a great Prime Minister," and accused EU leaders of destroying its culture and identity by letting in millions of migrants. Trump also said he felt "unwelcome" in London, referring to anti-Trump protesters that have flooded the streets of the capital during his visit. Later, during a joint press conference with Theresa May, Trump dismissed his interview with *The Sun* as "fake news."

6. **Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that he will sell all of the remaining stock he holds after he received a letter from the government's top ethics watchdog warning of "potential for a serious criminal violation."** The letter was sent by the Acting Director and General Counsel for the Office of Government Ethics, and faulted Ross for what it said were various omissions and inaccurate statements submitted by Ross to the OGE over the last year. The letter also faulted Ross for shorting certain positions that "appear to have been an ineffective attempt to remedy your actual or apparent failure to timely divest assets per your ethics agreement."

7. **The Trump administration argued in federal court that it has the right to hold detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba for up to 100 years â€” without charging them with a crime.** The administration argued that as long as operations continue against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, the U.S. retains the right to hold detainees at GTMO indefinitely. When Judge Thomas Hogan asked Justice Department attorney Ronald Wiltsie if, in the government's view, the war could last 100 years, Wiltsie said, "Yes, we could hold them for 100 years if the conflict lasts 100 years." There are still 26 prisoners at GTMO who remain there without charge or trial, including the eight men represented in court on Wednesday, and have been held at the facility for between 10 and 16 years.

8. **Trump's pick to be the No. 2 official at NASA is a long-time Senate aide with little-to-no experience in space operations or technology.** James Morhard, who currently serves as the Senate's deputy sergeant at arms, was chosen by Trump for the role of deputy administrator at NASA. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/396806-trump-pick-for-top-nasa-role-has-no-past-experience-in-space-tech) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/12/nasa-administrator-has-been-lobbying-space-professional-be-his-deputy-thats-not-who-white-house-nominated/?utm_term=.78e809eb798c))

9. **A federal auditor for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report urging the agency to recover at least $341,000 from its former secretary Tom Price.** Price spent the money on 20 trips that did not comply with federal requirements, the department's inspector general found. Price was forced out last year following media reports of his extravagant use of private and military aircraft, and has voluntarily repaid about $60,000 to the government.
