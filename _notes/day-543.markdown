1. **The summit between Trump and Putin began today in Helsinki, Finland.** "The time has come," Putin said in his opening remarks, "that we speak extensively about our bilateral relations and various problem points around the world. There are enough of them that we ought to pay attention to them." Trump, who spoke second, said he and Putin have a "lot of good things to talk about, and things to talk about," including military relations, trade, nuclear proliferation, and China. He also congratulated Putin on the success of the 2018 World Cup. Two hours into the one-on-one meeting with Putin, Trump declared it "a good start, a very good start for everybody."

* **Shortly before the summit with Putin began, Trump removed a senior official who is hawkish on Russia and supportive of NATO from his National Security Council.** The circumstances surrounding retired Army Col. Richard Hooker's departure from the NSC on June 29 remain in dispute. It's not clear whether he was fired or whether his term was simply over.

1. **Trump: "I think the European Union is a foe."** Days before his meeting with Putin, Trump capped off a contentious NATO summit in the U.K. by naming the European Union when asked to identify his "biggest foe globally right now." Speaking at his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump continued: "Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe."

2. **Trump told his top diplomats to initiate direct talks with the Taliban** in the hope of jump-starting negotiations to end the ongoing 17-year war in Afghanistan. The Taliban has long said that they will only discuss peace with the U.S. government, but the U.S. has, until now, mostly insisted that the Afghan government take part in the negotiations.

3. **Trump has already raised more than $88 million for his re-election campaign over the last year and a half.** The sum gives him a substantial head start when compared to prospective Democratic challengers in the 2020 election.

4. **Rep. Trey Gowdy ruled out the possibility of impeaching Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein**, citing a lack of support for his ouster. "Impeach him for what?" Gowdy said. "I'm not convinced there is a movement," he added. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/397127-gowdy-rules-out-rosenstein-impeachment))

5. **Jared Kushner's family firm emptied or sold more than 250 rent-stabilized apartments over the last three years** as Kushner Cos. converted one of its buildings into luxury condominiums.

6. **In the six months following the passage of Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act, worker pay has fallen while businesses have spent roughly $700 billion to repurchase their own stock.** When accounting for inflation, the reduction in worker pay is even steeper. The drop has affected 80 percent of industries and two-thirds of metro areas. ([CBS Money Watch](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/worker-wages-drop-while-companies-spend-billions-to-boost-stocks/))
