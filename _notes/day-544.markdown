1. **The U.S. Treasury will no longer require certain tax-exempt organizations like the NRA and Planned Parenthood to identify their financial donors to the IRS.** Traditional charity groups like 501(c)(3) organizations will still be required to disclose their donors to U.S. tax authorities, but Super PACS and other 501(c)(4) organizations will not. "Americans shouldn’t be required to send the IRS information that it doesn’t need to effectively enforce our tax laws," said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, "and the IRS simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area."

4. **The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem will cost almost 100 times more than Trump claimed in March.** "They put an order in front of my desk last week for $1 billion," Trump claimed at the time, "We’re actually doing it for about $250,000, so check that out." But a Maryland construction firm has now been awarded a $21.2 million contract to design and build "compound security upgrades" at the embassy.

5. **The top voting machine maker admitted to installing remote-access software on election-management systems it sold in the U.S. over a period of six years.** In a letter sent to Sen. Ron Wyden in April, Election Systems and Software admitted that it had "provided pcAnywhere remote connection software … to a small number of customers between 2000 and 2006," which was installed on the systems it sold to those customers. The statement contradicts previous claims by the company in February: "None of the employees, … including long-tenured employees, has any knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with remote-access software."
