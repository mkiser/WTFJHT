1. **The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is investigating the Trump Foundation on suspicion that it violated state tax laws.** Two state officials familiar with the investigation say it will focus on some of the same issues as the New York attorney general's lawsuit: campaign finance violations, self-dealing, and illegal coordination with the Trump campaign.

2. **Trump's proposed military parade in Washington, D.C. is likely to cost nearly much as the now-canceled military exercises with South Korea.** The parade is scheduled to take place on November 10 and is estimated to cost around $12 million, but cost estimates could still change as planning develops.
