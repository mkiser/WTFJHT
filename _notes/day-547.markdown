1. **The Trump administration has only reunited 364 of the more than 2,500 children who were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.** The administration has a week left before the court-imposed deadline to reunite the families. Of the 1,607 parents eligible for reunification, 719 have received final orders of deportation, meaning they could be deported as soon as they are reunited with their children.

2. **A Russian company indicted by Robert Mueller for interfering in the 2016 election has cited a decision by Trump's Supreme Court nominee to argue that the charges against the firm should be thrown out.** The ruling by Brett Kavanaugh prohibited foreigners from contributing to candidates or political parties, but it did not rule out donations or expenditures on independent advocacy campaigns.

3. **Mitch McConnell warned that he will delay Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote until just before the midterm elections in November if Democrats keep pushing for access to documents related to Trump's SCOTUS nominee.** Delaying the vote beyond September would keep vulnerable red-state Democrats off the campaign trail, while possibly forcing anti-Kavanaugh Democrats to deal with a major defeat shortly before the election.

4. **Trump says he is ready to impose tariffs on all $505 billion of Chinese goods imported into the United States.** "I'm ready to go to 500," Trump said during an interview. "I'm not doing this for politics, I'm doing this to do the right thing for our country," he continued. "We have been ripped off by China for a long time." So far, the U.S. has only imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, to which China has responded with tariffs of their own.
