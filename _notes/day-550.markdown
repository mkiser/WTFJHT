1. **The Trump administration disclosed previously top-secret documents related to the wiretapping of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.** According to the October 2016 application to the FISA Court to wiretap Page and several renewal applications, "The F.B.I. believes Page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government. \[REDACTED\] ...undermine and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in violation of U.S. criminal law. Mr. Page is a former foreign policy adviser to a candidate for U.S. president." The documents also indicate that the FBI believed "the Russian government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated" with the Trump campaign, and that Page "has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government." The release marks the first time that such an application has become public in the 40 years since Congress passed the law regulating wiretapping on American soil in search of domestic terrorists and spies.

2. **Carter Page admitted to working as an informal adviser to the Russian government.** He called allegations that he was a Russian spy "spin," a "ridiculous smear campaign," and "literally a complete joke" before acknowledged that he had referred to himself as an "informal adviser" to Russia in a 2013 letter.

3. **Trump once again reversed his position on whether he believes the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, tweeting that "it is all a big hoax."** "So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election," Trump tweeted Sunday night. "Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that’s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!"

4. **Trump threatened Iran via Twitter in all-caps on Sunday.** "To Iranian President Rouhani:," Trump tweeted. "NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!" The tweet was apparently a response to a speech Rhouhani gave, during which he warned the U.S. that any conflict with Iran would result in the "mother of all wars."

5. **Trump's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, suggested several years ago that the unanimous SCOTUS decision that forced Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes may have been wrongly decided.** In a transcript of a roundtable discussion with other lawyers that was published in the January-February 1999 issue of the Washington Lawyer, Kavanaugh asked, "Should *U.S. v. Nixon* be overruled on the ground that the case was a nonjusticiable intrabranch dispute? Maybe so." He also said, "*Nixon* took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official."

6. **White House Chief of Staff John Kelly signed off on an effort to remove three officials who were loyal to Scott Pruitt after the EPA secretary resigned earlier this month.** The White House moved quickly to remove the trio of Pruitt loyalists, in what one administration official described as a "purge." At least one of the former Pruitt aides had already planned to leave the EPA prior to Pruitt's departure, but the White House expedited his departure.

7. **GOP lawmaker Jason Spencer screamed the n-word multiple times, portrayed a racist caricature of a Chinese tourist in order to take up-skirt photos of a suspected terrorist's burka, and threatened to cut off the penises of suspected terrorists during the latest episode of Sacha Baron Cohen's "Who Is America?"** In a post-credits scene titled, "A Message to Terrorists from Rep. Jason Spencer," the Republican state representative from Georgia yells into the camera: "All you damn sand-n\*ggers over in the Middle East, we are tired of you coming to America and we are tired of you trying to threaten us." He continues, wielding a knife in front of a green screen: "We will cut off your dick, you understand? We will take your dick and we will shove it in your mouth." He then takes a bite out of a large sausage and asks, “How are you going to rape children and women without a dick?"
