1. **Giuliani suggested that Trump would agree to be interviewed by Robert Mueller as long as there are no questions about obstruction of justice.** The only questions Trump would be willing to answer, according to Giuliani, are questions about potential collusion between Russian and the Trump campaign. Mueller has not responded to Giuliani's proposal. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-24/trump-s-lawyers-submit-proposal-to-mueller-on-interview-terms))

2. **The Trump administration said in a court filing that 463 parents who were separated from their families at the border have been deported without their children.** The report to U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw said that the 463 cases are "under review," meaning that they do not represent the final tally of migrant parents who have been deported while their children remain inside U.S. detention centers.
