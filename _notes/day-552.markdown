1. **Michael Cohen's lawyer leaked one of the recordings of his conversations with Trump.** Trump is heard on the recording discussing how he and Cohen would buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen tells Trump about his plan to set up a company to pay for the rights to McDougal's story from American Media, Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer. The recording confirms that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge about the proposal to buy McDougal's story and suppress it.

1. **The White House deleted a key exchange between a reporter and Putin from the official transcript and video of Trump's recent summit with Putin in Helsinki.** During the press conference in Helsinki, a Reuters reporters asks Putin, "Did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?" Putin then responds, "Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal." The White House omitted the first part of the question, leaving only the second part in the official transcript and video. The Russian government removed the entire exchange from their official record as well.

2. **The Kremlin declined Trump's invitation to have Putin visit the White House for a second summit.** Yuri Ushakov says that while he agrees that there should be a second meeting between the two leaders, he did not formally agree to the White House's fall invitation. "After the summit, you know what kind of atmosphere there is around its outcome," Ushakov said, "I think it would be wise to let the dust settle and then we can discuss all these questions in a business-like way. But not now." ([Reuters](http://) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/398609-kremlin-russia-not-ready-to-accept-trump-invite-to-second-summit))

3. **The White House will no longer publish public summaries of Trump's phone calls with world leaders. It is unclear if the change will be temporary or permanent.** Trump has had at least two calls with foreign leaders in the last two weeks — one with Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — but he has declined to elaborate on what was said.

4. **Trump got mad that CNN was on the TV in Air Force One during his recent trip overseas.** Trump's standing rule is that all TVs aboard Air Force One should be tuned to Fox News whenever he's on board. Trump reportedly raged at his staff for breaking the programming rule. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/politics/trump-putin-cnn.html))

5. **Newly disclosed government emails reveal that the Trump administration began a hard push to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census within months of Trump taking office.** Steve Bannon began pushing Wilbur Ross as early as May 2017 to "talk to someone about the census." Ross began demanding that a citizenship question be added a month later. The emails cast further doubt on the administration's initial explanation that the Justice Department requested a citizenship question to comply with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

6. **Trump criticized the FCC for raising "serious concerns" and legal challenges about the Sinclair Broadcast Group's proposed merger with Tribune Media.** Trump said it was "so sad and unfair" that the FCC didn't approve the $3.9 billion merger that would have created a conservative television giant that would have reached approximately 70 percent of U.S. households. "This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People," Trump tweeted. "Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!"
