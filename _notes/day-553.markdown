1. **House Freedom Caucus leaders introduced articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.** Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows introduced the articles of impeachment. "The DOJ is keeping information from Congress. Enough is enough," Jordan said in a statement. "It’s time to hold Mr. Rosenstein accountable for blocking Congress’s constitutional oversight role." The resolution is unlikely to pass, as top GOP lawmakers have not signed on to the effort, but it represents the strongest step that conservative allies of Trump have taken so far in their feud with Rosenstein and the Justice Department.

2. **The government seized more than 100 recordings from Michael Cohen**, which include conversations Cohen had with reporters and others who were discussing matters related to Trump and his businesses. Cohen made some of the recordings with an iPhone, without telling anyone he was taping them. Most of the recordings involve conversations between Cohen and reporters who asked him about Trump during and after the 2016 election.

3. **The White House banned network pool reporter Kaitlan Collins from the Rose Garden because of the questions she asked Trump during a photo op.** In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the dis-invitation, claiming that Collins "shouted questions and refused to leave despite repeatedly being asked to do so." Sanders continued: "To be clear, we support a free press and ask that everyone be respectful of the presidency and guests at the White House."

4. **The Trump administration failed to document consent in the majority of cases where migrants were deported without their children.** The new information contradicts repeated claims by the White House that migrant parents gave consent to leave their children behind, and has been a key talking point for Trump administration officials who have defended the separations and deportations.

5. **Coca-Cola Company announced that it will raise prices in response to the financial strain caused by Trump's tariffs.** Coca-Cola's CEO said they are increasing prices due to the rising costs of delivery and metal prices after the U.S. imposed $50 billion in duties on Chinese products earlier this year.

6. **Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos proposed rolling back Obama-era loan forgiveness rules for students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges.** The proposal would require student borrowers to prove that they have fallen into hopeless financial straits or prove that their college knowingly deceived them in order to receive loan forgiveness. The proposal is set to go into effect a year from now. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/politics/betsy-devos-debt-relief-for-profit-colleges.html))

7. **Someone untied Betsy DeVos' 163-foot yacht and set it adrift on Lake Erie.** The Seaquest captain called police to report that the yacht had been untied and set adrift. By the time the police arrived, the $40-million yacht had hit a dock, causing large scratches and scrapes that are estimated to cost between $5,000 and $10,000 to repair. The yacht is one of ten boats owned by the DeVos family.

8. **A multi-state lawsuit challenging the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census will be allowed to move forward in court.** The suit, brought by more than two dozen states and cities and other groups, is the largest of six lawsuits arguing against the new citizenship question. In his opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman said the plaintiffs "plausibly allege that Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question was motivated at least in part by discriminatory animus and will result in a discriminatory effect."

9. **The man who used a pickax to vandalize Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week was bailed out of jail by the man who vandalized Trump's star in 2016.** Austin Clay was booked on suspicion of felony vandalism and held on $20,000 bail for the incident, but he was bailed out shortly after his arrest by James Otis, who pleaded no contest to felony vandalism charges in 2017 for a similar incident.
