1. **Michael Cohen claims Trump knew in advance about Don Jr.'s meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer, during which the Russians were expected to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton.** Cohen doesn't have any hard evidence to back up his claim, but he is reportedly willing to make the assertion as part of his testimony to Robert Mueller. Cohen claims he, along with several others, were in the room when Trump was told about the Russian's offer by Don Jr. According to Cohen, Trump approved the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
