1. **The Manhattan district attorney's office is considering criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior company officials in connection with Michael Cohen's hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.** The state investigation would focus on how the Trump Organizations accounted for the $130,000 reimbursement to Cohen. The review is in the earliest stages and prosecutors have yet to make a decision on how to proceed.

2. **Trump told the Italian prime minister that he is ready to help fund the country's public debt next year by buying Italian government bonds.** Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told officials about Trump's offer after attending a meeting in Washington about three weeks ago. Conte didn't give any additional details about the plan or say whether he believes it would work.

3. **Blackwater founder Erik Prince is once again trying to convince Trump to let him privatize the war in Afghanistan.** Prince hasn't spoken with Trump recently, but he has been making the rounds in the media and talking up his plan to replace U.S. and coalition forces with private contractors. Very few defense officials think Prince's plan will work, but some are concerned that Trump might entertain the idea. "We have to take this seriously because the commander-in-chief might take it seriously," said author and former mercenary Sean McFate, "and if the only logic is that everything else we have tried has failed so anything can work in the future, that’s an absurd logic." Prince is the brother of Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/403146-faced-with-opposition-erik-prince-shops-his-plan-for-afghanistan))
