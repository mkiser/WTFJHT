1. **The Department of Homeland Security diverted nearly $10 million from FEMA to help ICE pay for detention and removal operations.** A newly released budget document shows DHS diverted the funds from FEMA at the beginning of the hurricane season, which began in June. The money was taken out of FEMA's operations and support budget and was transferred into ICE accounts to pay for additional detention camps and other expenses. A spokesperson for DHS pushed back on Twitter: "Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster."

2. **Trump called the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico "totally incompetent"** after Yulin Cruz criticized Trump's statements about his response to the hurricanes that ravaged Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico last year. Trump tweeted: "We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan). We are ready for the big one that is coming!" ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-calls-san-juan-mayor-totally-incompetent/story?id=57767633))

3. **Trump plans to sign an executive order that would sanction and foreign companies or individuals who interfere with U.S. elections.** The determination as to whether a company or individual interfered in an election would be based on findings from U.S. intelligence agencies. The order would task of agencies with determining if meddling occurred, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, the NSA, and the Department of Homeland Security. It would require any federal agency aware of election interference by foreign entities to submit the information to the Director of National Intelligence for review.

4. **Three-quarters of the secret money spent in recent elections came from just 15 groups.** An analysis by the campaign-finance reform group Issue One found that many of these same 15 groups remain big players in the 2018 midterm elections, although the sources of their money remain mostly hidden from the public.

5. **The Trump administration is making it harder for Christian refugees to enter the United States.** Despite Trump's promise to help vulnerable Christians around the world, many groups remain in legal limbo while they await a decision on their fate, including a group of Iranian Christians waiting in Austria. The number of Christian refugees allowed to enter the U.S. has dropped by more than 40 percent (roughly 11,000 refugees) over the last year.
