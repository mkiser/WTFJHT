1. **Trump accused Democrats of using "false acquisitions" to destroy Brett Kavanaugh in a misspelled tweet last night.** Trump called Kavanaugh "a wonderful man, and a man who has the potential to be one of our greatest Supreme Court Justices ever," and said Democrats are using "an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before" to derail Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.

2. **Kavanaugh: "I have never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever."** Kavanaugh went on Fox News with his wife at his side and once again denied the allegations against him. "I'm not going anywhere," he declared. During the 20-minute interview, Kavanaugh said that he has "always treated women with dignity and respect" four separate times, and said that he was seeking a "fair process" a total of 17 times. He also attempted to refute the allegations against him by claiming that he remained a virgin until long after his high school years. "I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school," Kavanaugh said, "or for many years thereafter."

3. **Michael Avenatti said he will present information about at least one additional Kavanaugh accuser in the next 48 hours.** Avenatti says he is currently representing multiple clients, and "at least one" is prepared to come forward over the next two days. "We're going to make a public disclosure within the next 48 hours of detailed allegations," Avenatti said, "as well as the identity of at least one of my clients relating to what she witnessed and experienced concerning Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, and ultimately we're going to let the American public decide who's telling the truth."

Cruz then told the crowd "God bless you" before asking them to let him and his wife through so they could leave the restaurant.

We all appreciate his service and wish him well." The White House received the statement yesterday.
