1. **Sen. Diane Feinstein accused Brett Kavanaugh of misleading the Senate about his handling of grand jury secrets during his time working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the late nineties.** Feinstein charges that by directing officials to speak to reporters during the Bill Clinton investigation, Kavanaugh may have violated grand jury secrecy laws, even though he told Sens. Feinstein and Whitehouse during his testimony earlier this month that he never broke those rules.

2. **Senate Democrats have had no apparent contact with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, even as she prepares to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.** Dr. Ford's attorneys have been in contact with aides from both parties, but there has apparently been no coordination between Ford's camp and Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee.

3. **Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee have selected Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.** Mitchell is chief of the special victims division of the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, where she has worked for 26 years. Dr. Ford will testify under oath on Thursday, and Kavanaugh will testify separately later in the day.

4. **Kavanaugh's second accuser is willing to testify publicly before Congress.** An attorney representing Deborah Ramirez, the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, told NBC that his client would be willing to testify, but expressed concern about her doing so before the FBI is able to conduct an investigation into her claims. Ramirez's attorney also reiterated that she is certain about the alleged encounter, adding: "She believes wholeheartedly that it was Mr. Kavanaugh."

5. **A majority of Americans would oppose Kavanaugh's confirmation if Dr. Ford's allegations are proven to be true.** Fifty-nine percent of respondents said they think Kavanaugh should not be confirmed if Ford's claims are true, while 29 percent said they would support his confirmation either way.

6. **Rudy Giuliani posed for pictures with a Canadian white nationalist mayoral candidate.** Faith Goldy is a far-right YouTuber running for mayor in Toronto. She posted photos with Giuliani to her Instagram on Tuesday and tweeted about the encounter: "Just like Giuliani cleaned up the streets of NYC, our tough on crime playbook is going to run illegal guns & gangs right out of Toronto!"

7. **Sen. Orrin Hatch quietly weighed in on a Supreme Court case that could prevent state and federal courts from prosecuting someone for the same crime.** Hatch filed a brief on Sept. 11, in which he says the doctrine should be overturned. Overturning the dual-sovereignty doctrine established in *Gamble v. United States* would theoretically allow Trump to pardon people like Manafort for his federal crimes and simultaneously protect him from actions at the state level.
