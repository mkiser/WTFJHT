1. **An anonymous fourth accuser has come forward with new allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.** The anonymous complaint was sent to Republican Sen. Cory Gardner and claims that Kavanaugh physically assaulted a woman in the D.C. area in 1998 while he was drunk. The person who sent the complaint described an incident between her own daughter, Kavanaugh, and several friends in 1998. "When they left the bar (under the influence of alcohol)," the complaint says, "they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh, shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually." The author of the letter said there were "at least four witnesses including my daughter." When asked about the latest allegation during a call with Republican senators on Tuesday, Kavanaugh said "It’s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I’ve never done anything like that."

2. **Sen. Susan Collins raised concerns and questioned why the Judiciary Committee has not subpoenaed Kavanaugh's friend**, Mark Judge, after Kavanaugh's third accuser submitted her allegations in a sworn statement. Collins said the Julia Swetnick's affidavit brought her allegations to a new level since they were made under oath and carried the possibility of perjury for lying to Congress if Swetnick's allegations were proven to be false. Collins was concerned that Mark Judge had not been subpoenaed, even though he is listed in Swetnick's affidavit as a witness to the alleged events.

3. **Senate Judiciary Committee investigators interviewed two men earlier this week who believe they may have been the ones who assaulted Christine Blasey Ford instead of Brett Kavanaugh.** The two men suggested that Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh may have been a case of mistaken identity. One man submitted a written statement to the Judiciary Committee on Monday and a more in-depth statement on Wednesday. The second man spoke with investigators over the phone on Wednesday and said he believes he should be the target of Ford's allegations, not Kavanaugh. Senate Democrats were unaware that Republicans had been talking with the two men until they were informed about the conversations by reporters on Twitter.

4. **The House Intelligence Committee will vote on Friday to release dozens of interview transcripts from its now-defunct Russia investigation.** The transcripts are from interviews that were conducted between June 2017 and March 2018, and will include testimony from Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Roger Stone, and other people close who have been close to Trump. The Friday vote will refer the transcripts to the intelligence community for assessment and redaction, which could lead to a rolling release schedule that spans throughout October.
