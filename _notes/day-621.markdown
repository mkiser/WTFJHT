1. **Text messages between Brett Kavanaugh and one of his former classmates at Yale show Kavanaugh and his team were working behind the scenes to refute Deborah Ramirez's allegations against him before they were made public.** Kerry Berchem attended Yale with Kavanaugh and Ramirez, and has tried to get the text messages to the FBI so they can be reviewed as part of the newly opened investigation into the matter. Berchem says she has yet to be contacted by the FBI. During an interview with Republican Judiciary Committee staff on Sept. 25, Kavanaugh claimed that he found out about the allegations when they were published in the New Yorker. But the texts suggest that Kavanaugh was personally communicating with former classmates about the allegations before they were made public in a New Yorker article.

2. **As an undergraduate at Yale in 1985, Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar and was accused of throwing ice at another patron.** The incident led the New Haven Police Department to question Kavanaugh and four other men. Kavanaugh was not arrested in connection with the incident. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/politics/kavanaugh-bar-fight.html))

3. **Julie Swetnick spoke publicly for the first time about her allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. Swetnick claims she saw Kavanaugh behave inappropriately at parties in the 1980s.** "He was very aggressive — very sloppy drunk, very mean drunk," Swetnick said during an interview. "I saw him — go up to girls and paw on them, try to, you know, get a little too handsy, touching them in private parts. I saw him try to shift clothing." Swetnick said she only realized that she had a similar story to tell about Kavanaugh after seeing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford come forward to allege that Kavanaugh had attacked her during a party. Swetnick says she was raped at a party that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge attended, but she "cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me."

4. **Republican Sen. Susan Collins wants the FBI to investigate Julie Swetnick's allegations against Kavanaugh as part of its probe.** "Senator Collins was encouraged by the President’s statements that he would give the FBI agents the latitude they need to do their work," said a spokesperson for Sen. Collins. "It makes sense to start with the four named witnesses from the hearing and then the FBI can follow any leads that it believes need to be pursued, as Senators Flake, Murkowski, and Collins indicated at the time this agreement was made."

5. **Paul Manafort met on Monday with Robert Mueller's office as part of his cooperation agreement with the special counsel's Russia investigation.** The sit-down with Mueller's team stems from Manafort's guilty plea last month, with compels him to cooperate "fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly…in any and all matters as to which the government deems the cooperation relevant."

6. **The Trump administration on Monday began denying visas to unmarried same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats and United Nations employees, requiring those already in the U.S. to get married by the end of the year or leave the country.** The new policy applies to domestic partners of foreign diplomats and U.N. employees, including those who are from countries that criminalize same-sex marriage. Only 12 percent of U.N. members states allow same-sex marriage.
