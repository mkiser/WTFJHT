1. **Trump repeatedly mocked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at one of his rallies** by pretending to be Dr. Ford as she was questioned before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Thirty-six years ago this happened. I had one beer, right? I had one beer," Trump said. Trump ridiculed Dr. Ford's inability to remember certain details from the night she was sexually assaulted. "How did you get home?," he said as the crowd cheered. "I don’t remember. How’d you get there? I don’t remember. Where is the place? I don’t remember. How many years ago was it? I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. What neighborhood was it in? I don’t know. Where’s the house? I don’t know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know."
