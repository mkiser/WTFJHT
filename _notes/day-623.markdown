1. **Senators are preparing to review the FBI's completed report on the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh before they vote to advance his confirmation to a final vote**, which could come as early as Saturday. Mitch McConnell scheduled a key process vote for Friday. If the motion passes, Senators will have up to 30 hours to debate the confirmation before making the final decision. The White House says it is "fully confident" that the Senate will vote to confirm Kavanaugh.

2. **Sen. Jeff Merkley says "100 Senators will have to line up" to see the FBI's report on Brett Kavanaugh because only one copy will be made available for review.** Senators will view a single copy of the report in a secure room in one-hour shifts based on their political party. Sen. Dick Durbin called the process "bizarre," although the process is standard practice for FBI background reports. The report is confidential, so senators will be expected to refrain from discussing it publicly or repeating what they learn from the report.

3. **More than 1,200 law professors signed a letter opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.** The letter, which will be sent to the U.S. Senate, says Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial restraint during his hearing last week and should be disqualified from serving on the nation's highest court. The law professors discussed "with great distress, the unprecedented and unfathomable demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh." Hundreds of lawyers from more than 150 law schools across the country signed on to the letter within hours as part of "a spontaneous reaction to the hearing."

4. **One of Kavanaugh's former classmates at Yale says Kavanaugh lied under oath about his drinking and about the meaning of his yearbook entries.** "Brett Kavanaugh stood up under oath and lied about his drinking and about the meaning of words in his yearbook," writes James Roche. "He did so baldly, without hesitation or reservation." Roche said there is "zero chance" that Deborah Ramirez made up her accusation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party. He also said Kavanaugh lied about never blacking out from drinking, and about the definition of the word "boofing."

5. **A federal judge blocked Trump's attempt to end Temporary Protective Status for more than 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.** The ruling temporarily prevents Trump from forcing them, many of whom have lived in the United States for decades, to find another immigration status or face deportation. The judge ruled that those TPS recipients and their children would "indisputably" face irreparable harm and hardship if they were to lose protected status by "tearing them away from the only country and community they have known."

6. **Robert Mueller's team has gained possession of radio interviews between Roger Stone and radio host Randy Credico, who Stone claimed was his back channel to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.** The radio interviews took place between August 2016 and April 2017 on local New York station WBAI. Credico has denied Stone's claim that he was the intermediary between Stone and Assange. Mueller is investigating Stone's possible involvement in Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
