1. **The Senate voted 51-49 to advance Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination**. Republican Lisa Murkowski voted not to advance the nomination. She called the cloture vote "a mistake" and that Kavanaugh is "not the best man for the court at this time." Democrat Joe Manchin voted in favor. Confirmation is not assured as Sens. Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Murkowski, and Manchin could vote differently during Saturday's final confirmation vote. Flake, however, said he would support Kavanaugh on the final vote "unless something big changed. I don't see what would."
