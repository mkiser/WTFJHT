1. **Trump said he will withdraw the U.S. from a landmark Cold War-era treaty with Russia that eliminated nuclear missiles from Europe.** Trump said he was withdrawing from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty because Russia has violated the agreement. "Russia has not, unfortunately, honored the agreement," Trump told reporters, "so we’re going to terminate the agreement and we’re going to pull out." The INF Treaty was negotiated in 1987 by Pres. Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and required the elimination of all short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries.

2. **The Trump administration wants to narrowly define gender as an immutable, biological determination based on genitalia at the time of birth.** The plan represents the most drastic attempt yet by the government to roll back recognition and protections for transgender people under current federal civil rights law. The Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading the effort, which seeks to establish a new legal definition under Title IX that defines gender "on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable."
