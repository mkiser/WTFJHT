2. **Another suspicious package may have been sent to Joe Biden.** Law enforcement officials are trying to track down the package, which has been deemed suspicious because it was misaddressed and shipped to the return address, just like some of the other packages.

3. **Another suspicious package was sent to a restaurant owned by Robert De Niro.** The device arrived at the Tribeca Grill in Manhattan early Thursday morning. If the package is confirmed to be an explosive device, it would be the ninth bomb sent to outspoken critics of Trump this week. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45975447)) 

4. **The explosive device sent to CNN's offices in New York included an ISIS flag meme that has been circulating in right-wing online circles since 2014.** The image features a black flag with the Arabic symbols replaced by the silhouettes of three women and an inscription in the middle that reads, "Get ‘Er Done," which is comedian Larry the Cable Guy's catchphrase.

5. **American intelligence reports indicate that Chinese spies are often listening in on Trump's cellphone calls and using the information to affect U.S. policy.** Trump's aides have repeatedly warned him that his calls are not secure and that Chinese and Russian spies are eavesdropping on his calls, but Trump refuses to give up his iPhones. "I only use Government Phones," Trump tweeted in response to the reports, "and have only one seldom used government cell phone." He added: "Story is soooo wrong!"

6. **Trump plans to unveil sweeping changes to how Medicare pays for certain drugs.** Trump says the changes are meant to address the issue of "foreign freeloaders" who he says drive up costs in the U.S. The proposal would use Medicare's innovation center to test strategies for lowering drug prices, including negotiating for some drugs that are directly administered by doctors in order to keep prices in line with that of other countries.

7. **A former GOP congressional candidate in Madison, Wisconsin was arrested for "trying to buy radioactive material with the intent to kill someone."** Jeremy Ryan, who ran against House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2014 and ran again in the 2018 primaries, was arrested for allegedly attempting to buy a "lethal dose of a radioactive substance" online between March and October 2018. Ryan's target has not been identified by police, and he is currently facing up to life in prison if convicted.
