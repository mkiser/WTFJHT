1. **Democrats took back control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, while Republicans managed to hold on to their majority in the Senate.** Republican governors were elected in Ohio and Florida, while Democrats beat Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Gov. Schuette in Michigan. Democrats won big in the suburbs, which are typically Republican strongholds. High-profile progressive candidates in Georgia, Florida, and Texas were defeated by Republican candidates.

2. **More than 100 women were elected to federal office, including the first Native American and first Muslim women elected to Congress.** Maine and South Dakota also elected their first female governors. The GOP even elected several female candidates, with Marsha Blackburn becoming Tennessee's first female senator.  In New York, Democratic Socialist Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at age 29, followed shortly by Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer.
