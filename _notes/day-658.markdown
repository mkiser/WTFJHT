1. **Progressive groups are calling for nationwide protests today at 5 p.m. local time to demand protection for Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.** The protests will be held under the banner, "Nobody is Above the Law," and will be led by the activist group MoveOn. The protests were triggered by Trump's decision to fire Jeff Sessions and replace him with Matthew Whitaker, who will now have authority over the Russia investigation. Sessions recused himself after he was first appointed in 2016, giving Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversight of the probe. Whitaker has publicly called for Mueller's probe to be reigned in.

2. **Trump suspended the White House press credentials of CNN's Jim Acosta after a heated exchange at a press conference yesterday.** Acosta refused to give up the microphone and repeatedly challenged Trump on his characterization of a group of Central American migrants and refugees making their way north to the U.S. southern border. Acosta was refused access when he tried to re-enter the White House later that evening and was asked to hand over his "hard pass," which gives journalists access to the premises.

3. **Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fell in her office at the court and fractured three ribs on her left side.** She was admitted to the hospital for treatment and observation. "She went home, but after experiencing discomfort overnight, went to George Washington University Hospital early this morning," the court said. Ginsburg fractured her ribs while on the court in June 2012.

4. **The Trump administration issued a pair of federal rules that allow some employers to deny insurance coverage for contraception to their employees on religious or moral grounds.** The rules provide exceptions to an Obama-era interpretation of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide essential health benefits at no charge to consumers, including birth control.
