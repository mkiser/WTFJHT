1. **Robert Mueller's office says former national security adviser Michael Flynn should serve no jail time because he provided "substantial" cooperation with the Russian probe.** A court filing submitted by the special counsel's office says Flynn provided "firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials." Flynn gave 19 interviews to Mueller's team and other investigators and, as a result, Mueller asked a federal judge not to sentence Flynn to prison. Flynn also provided details about other criminal investigations, but those details were heavily redacted from the court filing in order to keep information about ongoing probes secret.

2. **Mueller's team also disclosed more details about Flynn's efforts to cover up his ties to Turkey while he was Trump's national security adviser.** A big part of Flynn's involvement with the Turkish government were his attempts to kidnap a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania and return him to Turkey to face punishment for allegedly orchestrating a failed coup attempt against Turkish President Erdogan. Flynn's decision to hide the fact that he was working for Turkey "impeded the ability of the public to learn about the Republic of Turkey's efforts to influence public opinion about the failed coup, including its efforts to effectuate the removal of a person legally residing in the United States."

3. **Giuliani tried to blame Twitter for "invading my text with a disgusting anti-President message"** after he accidentally created a link to [G-20.In](www.G-20.In) in one of his tweets. A Twitter user noticed that the domain was unclaimed, so they bought it and created a website with the simple message: "Donald J. Trump is a traitor to our country," allowing anyone who clicked on the link in Giuliani's tweet to view the website. Giuliani tried to claim that the incident was proof that Twitter employees are "committed cardcarrying anti-Trumpers." Giuliani ended his tweet with a call for "FAIRNESS PLEASE."

4. **Trump told his aides that he isn't worried about the booming national debt because "I won't be here" when America has to pay its creditors back.** The U.S. currently owes roughly $21 trillion in debt, but Trump has repeatedly shrugged those financial obligations off during meetings about the national debt. "Yeah," Trump told his aides, "but I won't be here." ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-on-coming-debt-crisis-i-wont-be-here-when-it-blows-up))
