1. **The House of Representatives passed a stopgap measure to fund the government that includes $5 billion in border wall funding.** The bill passed 217 to 185 but is expected to be rejected in the Senate. The measure does nothing to prevent a potential government shutdown. The vote puts the House at odds with the Senate, which passed its own funding bill on Wednesday that does not include money for the wall. The Senate will have to consider the House version before midnight tonight in order to avoid a partial government shutdown. Mitch McConnell has suggested that members should be ready for a vote later tonight.

2. **Trump has shifted to blaming Democrats for a potential government shutdown at midnight tonight, even though he explicitly said last week that he would proudly take credit for the shutdown if funding for his border wall was not included in a year-end spending bill.** "Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!" Trump tweeted. Trump also urged Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to "use the Nuclear Option and get it done!" because "Our Country is counting on you!" Trump warned that "If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time."

3. **The Trump administration has ordered the Pentagon to draft plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan.** The plans are due early next year, and must include multiple options for withdrawal. No decision has been made yet, Trump just wants to see options. The U.S. currently has 14,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan and has been occupying the country for 17 years — the longest war in U.S. history.
