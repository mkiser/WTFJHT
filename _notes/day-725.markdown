1. **The FBI opened an investigation days after Trump fired Comey to determine whether Trump had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia.** Law enforcement officials became so concerned with Trump's behavior that they began investigating whether Trump's own actions constituted a threat to national security. Investigators also worked to determine whether Trump was purposefully working for Moscow or had unwittingly fallen prey to Russia's influence.

2. **Trump went to extraordinary lengths to hide information about his conversations with Vladimir Putin.** On at least one occasion in 2017, Trump took the notes from his interpreter and told the interpreter not to discuss the details of his conversation with Putin with other administration officials. U.S. officials only learned about Trump's actions when a White House adviser and a senior State Department official requested additional information about the meeting, beyond what Rex Tillerson had provided.

3. **The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed off on a plan by Alexander Torshin and Maria Butina to infiltrate the NRA and the American conservative movement.** A U.S. intelligence report says Torshin, a Russian central bank official, courted NRA leaders for years and briefed the Kremlin on his efforts, recommending that they participate in the project. The report notes that the Kremlin was fine with Torshin and his protegée Maria Butina's courtship of the NRA because those relationships would be valuable if a Republican was elected president in 2016.

4. **Trump sold about $35 million worth of real estate in 2018 while serving as president.** Although he offloaded the daily management of his assets to his sons, he maintained ownership of his businesses. More than half of the $35 million came from a single real estate deal involving a federally subsidized housing complex in Brooklyn, which Trump and his business partners offloaded for roughly $900 million. Trump held a 4% stake in the property and pulled in $20 million after subtracting the $370 million in debt owed on housing complex.

5. **A federal judge in California blocked Trump administration rules that would allow more employers to avoid providing women with no-cost birth control in 13 states and the District of Columbia**. Judge Haywood Gilliam issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled today. The injunction limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, preventing the rules from going into effect nationwide.
