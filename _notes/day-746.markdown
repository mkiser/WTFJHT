1. **Trump says he plans to keep U.S. troops in Iraq to monitor and pressure Iran.** The U.S. has been quietly negotiating with Iraq for weeks to move hundreds of troops stationed in Syria to bases in Iraq so they can continue to attack ISIS strongholds from there. Iraqi President Barham Salih said Trump did not ask for permission to station more U.S. troops in his country to watch Iran. Iraq and Iran are allies.

2. **Trump said he doesn't have to agree with his intelligence chiefs over their assessment that ISIS hasn't been fully defeated.** Trump also disagreed with the intelligence community's assessment that Iran is in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal. "I have intel people," Trump said, "but that doesn't mean I have to agree."

3. **Trump spent roughly 60% of the last three months in unstructured "Executive Time."** Trump usually spends the first five hours of the day in so-called Executive Time, during which he stays in the White House residence and watches TV, reads the news, and calls people to respond to what he sees and reads. Trump's first meeting of the day usually starts around 11:30am. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html))

4. **Trump said he's not sure if he wants Robert Mueller's final report to be made public.** Trump said he would leave that decision "totally up to to the attorney general." Trump's nominee for attorney general William Barr said during his confirmation hearing last week month that the public might just see a report from the AG on Mueller's conclusions. If the AG decides not to make the report public, Congress could subpoena it or compel officials to testify about the report's findings.
