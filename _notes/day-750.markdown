1. **House Democrats will convene the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight today, taking the first step toward obtaining Trump's tax returns.** The subcommittee will examine the legislative proposals and laws that lay out the process for securing the documents. One measure from 1924 allows the chairman of the tax-writing subcommittee to privately review anyone's tax returns. Once they get the documents, the committee would need a majority vote in order to release them to the public.

2. **The Trump administration plans to roll back Obama-era restrictions on payday lenders and vehicle title loans.** The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to get rid of a rule that requires payday lenders and others who provide "Certain High-Cost Installment Loans" to try and find out if borrowers can afford to pay back the loans before making them. The rollback happened just after Trump replaced the previous CFPB director with Mick Mulvaney, who now serves as Active White House Chief of Staff.

3. **New rules being put in place by the Trump administration will make it easier for U.S. weapons manufacturers to export semi-automatic weapons, flamethrowers, and some grenades overseas.** The new rules no long require manufacturers to obtain licenses from the State Department in order to cell certain weapons to foreign countries. Under the new rules, sellers will only need to get a no-fee license from the Commerce Department, which make it harder to track how the weapons are used once they're sold.

4. **The boyfriend of Russian spy Maria Butina was indicted by a federal grand jury in South Dakota for wire fraud and money laundering.** Paul Erickson was arrested and pled "not guilty" to charges that allege he used a chain of assisted living homes called Compass Care to run a criminal scheme from 1996 to 2018. He also allegedly defrauded his investors using a company called Investing with Dignity and claiming to be "in the business of developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the wheelchair." The indictment also alleges that Erickson fraudulently claimed to be building homes in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota. His case is separate from the case against Butina in Washington, D.C.

5. **T-Mobile executives involved in the company's megamerger with Sprint booked at least 52 nights at Trump's D.C. hotel since the deal was approved.** Newly obtained records from the hotel show T-Mobile executives booked more nights than previously reported, sometimes staying in rooms that cost up to $2,246 per night. Trump still owns the hotel, despite turning day-to-day control over to his sons Eric and Don Jr. ([Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/t-mobile-executives-seeking-merger-approval-booked-more-than-52-nights-at-trumps-hotel--more-than-previously-known/2019/02/06/cd6fa7e6-29ca-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html))
