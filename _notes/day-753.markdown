1. **Negotiations meant to avoid another partial government shutdown have reached an impasse.** The talks remain in the same place they've been for months: Trump wants money for his border wall and Democrats refuse have refused to cede ground and have been calling instead for caps on the detention of migrants at the border and those already in the country. The 17 House and Senate negotiators had hoped to reach a deal by Monday, but communications ceased just hours before the artificial deadline. The only things being discussed at the moment are a temporary Homeland Security spending bill or a possible national emergency declaration by Trump.
