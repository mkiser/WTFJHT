1. **Paul Manafort "repeatedly and brazenly" broke the law and the "crimes he engaged in while on bail were not minor; they went to the heart of the criminal justice system," according to an 800-page court filing by Robert Mueller.** The filing was unsealed on Saturday, and it includes a note from Mueller indicating that federal sentencing guidelines suggest Manafort should receive a sentence of 17 to 22 years in prison when he appears in the D.C. court on March 13. Mueller did not recommend a specific sentence to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, but he did call on the judge to issue a harsh one for the former GOP operative and Trump campaign manager. Mueller said Manafort engaged in a "bold" string of criminal actions and an extensive pattern of deceit that "remarkably went unabated even after indictment."

2. **House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says Democrats plan to subpoena Mueller's final report on his findings in the Russia investigation and bring Robert Mueller in to testify if the full report is not given to Congress.** "We will obviously subpoena the report," Schiff said. "We will bring Bob Mueller in to testify before Congress; we will take it to court if necessary. And in the end, I think the (Justice) Department understands they’re going to have to make this public." ([ABC News](We will obviously subpoena the report.

3. **Michael Cohen met with federal prosecutors in Manhattan last month and offered new information about possible irregularities within Trump's family business and about one of the donors to Trump's inaugural committee.** Most of the details remain unknown, but Cohen did speak with prosecutors about insurance claims filed by the company over the years. It's not clear whether prosecutors found Cohen's information credible or actionable. Cohen also told prosecutors about Imaad Zuberi, a donor to Trump's inaugural committee. Zuberi tried to hire Cohen as a consultant and wrote him a check for $100,000 around the same time that Zuberi donated $900,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. There is no indication that Cohen implicated Trump in the possible irregularities discussed last month.

4. **A bipartisan group of 58 former national security officials will issue a joint statement today denouncing Trump's national emergency declaration.** "There is no factual basis" for Trump to proclaim a national emergency in order to build his border wall, the statement says. Signatories include former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel. "Under no plausible assessment of the evidence," the statement reads, "is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border." The statement comes a day before the House is expected to vote on a measure to block Trump's declaration. The statement is intended to support the multiple ongoing lawsuits challenging Trump's decision.

1. **The White House plans to set up a panel of select federal scientists that will reassess the U.S government's analysis of current climate science in order to counter the overwhelming scientific consensus that the continued use of fossil fuels is destroying the planet.** The panel is an initiative of the National Security Council, and would include scientists who question the severity and extent of anthropogenic global warming. The group will not be subject to the same level of public disclosure as formal advisory committees, which are required meet in public, are subject to public records requests, and require representative membership.

2. **Russian state television aired a list of U.S. military facilities that Moscow would target in the event of a nuclear war and noted that Russia is developing hypersonic missiles that would be able to hit those targets in less than five minutes**. The targets include the Pentagon and the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. The unusually aggressive broadcast comes just days after Putin said Russia was ready for a "Cuban Missile"-style standoff with the United States if Washington deploys more intermediate-range nuclear missiles in western Europe.

3. **The Taliban and American diplomats are scheduled to begin the highest-level negotiations yet between the two groups on Monday.** The talks will be held in the presence of the Taliban's deputy leader with the hopes of making progress toward an end to the 18-year war in Afghanistan. The talks will be held in Doha, Qatar, and will focus on working out the details of the agreement both sides said they reached in principle last month. The Taliban agreed to keep Afghan territory from becoming a haven for terrorists if the U.S. agreed to move toward a withdrawal of American forces from the country.
