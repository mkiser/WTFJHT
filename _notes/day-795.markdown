1. **Attorney General William Barr says Mueller's team found no evidence that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated" with Russia during the 2016 election.** Barr submitted [a four-page summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5779699-Letter-to-Congress-detailing-Robert-Mueller-s.html) of Robert Mueller's report to Congress for review over the weekend. Democrats are demanding to see the full report from Mueller, and are questioning Barr's conclusions. Democrats are also calling on the full Mueller report to be made public.

2. **Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice.** Democrats say Mueller found some evidence for and some evidence against the charge of obstruction and are demanding to see the full report. Barr's summary of Mueller's findings says Mueller set out "evidence on both sides of the question" of obstruction. It also says that "while this report does not conclude the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him." Barr said that he and deputy AG Rod Rosenstein believe Mueller's report contained insufficient evidence to prove in court that Trump obstructed justice.

3. **House Democrats want to see the full report from Mueller and are calling on Barr to appear before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions.** "It is unacceptable," said Chairman Jerry Nadler," that after Special Counsel Mueller spent 22 months meticulously uncovering this evidence, Attorney General Barr made a decision not to charge the President in under 48 hours." Nadler called on Barr to "release the report and the underlying evidence in full," and to appear before the committee "without delay."

4. **Trump immediately declared "complete and total exoneration" on Sunday.** "It’s a shame that our country has had to go through this," he lamented. "To be honest, it’s a shame that your president has had to go through this."
