1. **Trump help a rally in Michigan in the wake of what he calls his "complete and total exoneration" by William Barr's summary of Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.** "After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead," Trump told the crowd. "The collusion delusion is over." Trump also used his time on stage to attack House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff, who has led the charge to investigate Trump's dealings with Russia and continues to insist that he has seen clear evidence of collusion. "Little pencil-neck Adam Schiff," Trump said at the rally. "He’s got the smallest, thinnest neck I’ve ever seen." Trump also called for retribution against "All of the Democrat politicians. The media bosses. Bad people. The crooked journalists," and everyone else who "paid for, promoted, and perpetuated the single greatest hoax in the history of politics, they have to be — I’m sorry — they have to be accountable," Trump said. The crowd responded with chants of "Lock them up!"

2. **Trump-appointee Seema Verma directed millions of dollars in government contracts to Republican communications consultants** during her time as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Some of the deals Verma managed were approved over the objections of agency staffers who were concerned that she was spending federal funding on GOP consultants to amplify coverage of her own work.
