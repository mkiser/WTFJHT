1. **Trump said he doesn't want any current or former White House aides to testify to Congress** in the wake of the Mueller report. He said complying with congressional requests was unnecessary and that there was "no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it’s very partisan." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-is-opposed-to-white-house-aides-testifying-to-congress-deepening-power-struggle-with-hill/2019/04/23/0c7bd8dc-65e0-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html?noredirect=on))

2. **A Justice Department filing contradicts Jared Kushner's characterization of Russia's influence campaign in the U.S. as simply "buying some Facebook ads and trying to sow dissent."** The filing describes how the actions of Russian spy Maria Butina contained all the markings of a sophisticated intelligence operation. The filing also argues that it doesn't take a master spy for such an operation to have a significant impact. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/23/jared-kushner-fbi-butina-1288769))

3. **Paul Manafort is now in federal prison.** Manafort was convicted and pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple charges of fraud, conspiracy, and tax evasion and is serving 7.5 years in a high-security federal prison in Pennsylvania. He is expected to be released on Christmas Day in 2024. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/former-trump-campaign-chair-paul-manafort-now-federal-prison-n997511))

4. **Twitter suspended more than 5,000 pro-Trump bot accounts for "platform manipulation."** The accounts were connected to a network that is focused on denouncing the Mueller report as a "hoax." There were also connected to other accounts that have been used to spread pro-Saudi messaging on the platform. An investigation into the network is ongoing but it's still unclear who is behind the campaign.
