1. **Trump lost $1.17 billion between 1985 and 1994 — more than "nearly any other individual American taxpayer" during that period.** New tax documents show Trump lost more than $250 million each year in 1990 and 1991, more than twice as much as the nearest taxpayers, according to IRS data from those years. Trump lost so much money during the decade in question that he was able to avoid paying any income taxes for eight of those ten years. The Art of the Deal was published in 1987, two years after Trump reported larger financial losses than all but three other individual American taxpayers.

* **TL;DR: Five takeaways from 10 years of Trump tax figures** ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/trump-tax-figures.html))

1. **Robert Mueller and his team didn't want James Comey's [contemporaneous memos](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/comey-memo-release/index.html) from his meetings with Trump to be released to the public because he worried that Trump and other witnesses might change their stories after reading them.** The Justice Department asked a federal judge to keep the memos under seal around the same time Mueller's team was negotiating with Trump's legal team over a potential interview with Trump. Mueller's team was worried that "the recollections of one witness, if disclosed to another potential witness, have the potential to \[influence\], advertently or inadvertently, the recollections of that witness."

2. **The Department of Justice said it will ask Trump to invoke executive privilege over the Mueller report if the House Judiciary Committee follows through on its threat to hold AG William Barr in contempt.** Committee chair Jerry Nadler still plans to hold contempt proceedings today after Barr missed another deadline to respond to subpoenas from the Committee. Nadler said the White House waived its right to invoke executive privilege "long ago," and claimed that the DOJ's threat was backed up by legal arguments that "are without credibility, merit, or legal or factual basis." Negotiations between the two broke down on Tuesday.

3. **The House Oversight Committee threatened to withhold the salaries of employees at the Department of the Interior who prevent lawmakers from interviewing agency employees** about whether Secretary David Bernhardt complied with recordkeeping laws. Committee chair Elijah Cummings issued a statement notifying the department that there would be no money available to pay the salaries of any "federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress."

4. **Michael Cohen claimed he helped bury embarrassing photos of Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. shortly before Falwell's endorsement of Trump.** The Falwells wanted to prevent "a bunch of photographs, personal photographs" from becoming public, Cohen said during a recorded phone call with actor Tom Arnold. "I actually have one of the photos," he said. "It's terrible." An anonymous attorney for Falwell Jr. denied Cohen's claims and insisted that "there are no compromising or embarrassing photos of Falwell, period!" ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-falwell-exclusive/exclusive-trump-fixer-cohen-says-he-helped-falwell-handle-racy-photos-idUSKCN1SD2JG) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cohen-claimed-he-helped-bury-personal-photographs-of-jerry-falwell-jr-before-the-evangelical-leader-backed-trump/2019/05/07/5e5c1664-7114-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html?noredirect=on))

5. **Top Trump foreign policy officials are exaggerating the alleged military threat from Iran.** National Security Adviser John Bolton announced that the U.S. was sending an aircraft carrier and a bomber group to the Middle East in response to "troubling and escalatory" warnings from Iran and intelligence reports indicating that Iran planned to attack U.S. forces using proxies. But multiple sources say Bolton and other administration officials are inflating the threat. "We’re sending a message with this reaction to the intelligence, even though the threat might not be as imminent as portrayed," one source explained.
