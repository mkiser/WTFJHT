1. **Robert Mueller made his first public statement about the Russia investigation.** He announced that he is resigning as special counsel and closing the special counsel's office now that the investigation is complete. He also reiterated the fact that his team couldn't say definitively that Trump did not commit a crime. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime," he explained, "we would have said so. We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime." Mueller explained that his team did not reach a conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice because they were prohibited from doing so under an opinion from the Justice Department which says a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller gave his statement from a podium at the Justice Department and did not take any questions. He concluded his remarks by reiterating the report's conclusion that "There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American."

1. **Mitch McConnell says he would work to confirm a new Supreme Court justice if a vacancy occurs during next year's presidential election.** In contrast, McConnell refused to confirm Obama's nominee after the death of Antonin Scalia during the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. McConnell claimed that voters had a right to decide whether a Democrat or Republican should fill the open seat on the Court. When asked what his position would be when it came to filling a potentially vacant seat next year, however, McConnell smiled and said, "Oh, we'd fill it."

2. **The vast majority of money from Trump's bailout for farmers is likely to go to the largest farms, not the small mom-and-pop farms**. Farms with annual revenues of several million dollars are likely to see the most bailout money. Most are major beneficiaries of federal crop support programs that handle billions of dollars in subsidies and low-cost crop insurance. Findings from the Environmental Working Group suggest that "the biggest payments will go to the wealthiest farmers, who need them the least."

3. **Trump's tax cuts have had "a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy" and they are failing to pay for themselves**, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Despite claims that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would add "rocket fuel" to the U.S. economy, the CRS found the law was mostly beneficial to investors. Wages are only growing at 2 percent, companies are seeing a bigger increase in earnings than employees, and "ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates."

4. **It's been a year since the Pentagon has held an on-camera press briefing with any department spokesperson.** "We’re talking about some sort of strike on another country and nobody knows why," said one Pentagon reporter. A spokesperson for the Defense Department pushed back against the claim, saying, "It depends what your definition of a briefing is."
