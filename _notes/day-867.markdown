1. **A 40-year-old migrant woman died while in U.S. Border Patrol custody**, making her the second migrant woman to die within a 36-hour period. Border Patrol agents detained the woman in Eagle Pass, TX on Monday and she collapsed minutes later. She was transported to a hospital, where she died shortly after arriving. On Saturday, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.

2. **Border Patrol agents are boarding buses and trains across the northern U.S. with increasing frequency to ask passengers about their citizenship status**, often nowhere near the U.S. border. Newly obtained emails show a Border Patrol official in Maine told agents "Happy hunting!" as they prepared to begin boarding buses. The searches can happen as much as three time per day at some northern bus stations, even at those with no direct routes to or from the border, causing bus delays and missed connections.

3. **The House passed the DREAM and Promise Act of 2019**, which would give millions of young undocumented a pathway to citizenship. The measure passed with a vote of 327 to 187, and it now heads to the Senate, where it is unlikely to be considered. The White House has also threatened to veto the measure if it makes it to Trump's desk. Seven Republicans voted in favor of the measure, and no Democrats voted against it.

4. **A federal judge said the Justice Department does not have to turn over the transcripts of Michael Flynn's calls with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak as part of Flynn's sentencing.** The DOJ originally failed to turn over the transcripts, saying they did not have any additional documents to share with the court that could help at sentencing. The judge, who is known for his demands for transparency and his severe reaction to Flynn's behavior in the White House, said "the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket."

5. **House Democrats rejected calls to preemptively cancel a House vote to hold AG William Barr in contempt**, but said they are willing to reopen negotiations with the DOJ over Mueller's full, un-redacted report. Rep. Jerry Nadler said he was willing to try to find a compromise, but only "without conditions" from the Justice Department. "We urge you not to make the mistake of breaking off accommodations again," Nadler warned last night. "We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning."
