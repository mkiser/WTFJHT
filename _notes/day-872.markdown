1. **Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao set up a special liaison to deal with grant applications from her husband Mitch McConnell's state of Kentucky**, allowing at least $78 million for preferred projects to go through while McConnell campaigned for reelection. Chao personally asked Todd Inman to serve as intermediary and help advise McConnell and local officials on specific grants that McConnell designated. One grant for a highway-improvement project in a McConnell political stronghold had already been rejected on two separate occasions. By designating Inman as a special intermediary for Kentucky, Chao was able to provide a special advantage to projects favored by her husband.

2. **Mexico had already agreed to deploy its National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border several months before Trump announced the move on Friday. **The Mexican government agreed to the "deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border" during secret talks with Kirstjen Nielsen back in March. The agreement to allow asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases proceed was reached back in December. Recent attempts to persuade Mexico to agree on a "safe third country" treaty that would allow the U.S. to legally reject asylum-seekers under certain conditions failed, but Trump hailed the agreement anyway on Saturday.

3. **A bipartisan group of Senators are attempting to block Trump's sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.** Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are using a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act to request a report from the Trump administration on Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which could trigger a vote to halt the billions of dollars in arms sales that Mike Pompeo is pushing for despite opposition from Congress.
