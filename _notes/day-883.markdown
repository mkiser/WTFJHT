1. **Trump ordered ICE to begin a mass roundup of migrant families that have received deportation orders and to begin conducting predawn raids in major U.S. cities starting on Sunday**. The operation, knows as the "family op" at ICE and DHS, will target up to 2,000 families facing deportation orders in up to 10 U.S. cities, including Houston, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, and other major immigration destinations. Trump has been determined to go forward with the operation after tweeting on Monday that the raids were coming "next week" and would result in "millions" of deportations. ICE has already been prepping agents and equipment for the operation, which is expected to unfold over the course of several days, and is planning to use hotels as temporary staging areas to detain parents and children until the entire family is ready for deportation.

2. **ICE has deported more immigrants during the first eight months of this fiscal year than any full fiscal year of Trump's presidency**, but he has yet to match Obama's early deportation numbers. ICE deportations fell to 226,119 in fiscal 2017, they rose to more than 250,000 in fiscal 2018 and hit a Trump administration high of 282,242 as of June this fiscal year.

3. **A legal team interviewed 60 children at a migrant detention facility near El Paso, TX and were told stories of neglect and mistreatment at the hands of the U.S. government**. The lawyers warned that kids are forced to take care of other kids. There is also inadequate food, water, and sanitation for the 250 infants, children, and teens currently detained at the Border Patrol station.

4. **Trump authorized military strikes against Iran but called off the attack at the last minute**. Trump initially approved attacks against a handful of Iranian targets, including radar and missile batteries. Planes were already in the air and ships were in position when the order came to stand down. The attack would have been Trump's third military strike against targets in the Middle East. The strike was meant to be a response to Iran's downing of an American surveillance drone. Iran says the drone violated Iranian airspace, while the U.S. says the drone was shot down in international airspace.

5. **Iran received a message from Trump via Oman warning that an attack on Iran was imminent**. Iranian officials said Trump claimed he was "against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues." They also said Trump "gave a short period of time to get our response but Iran’s immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader." Another official said they would deliver Trump's message to the Ayatollah, "however, we told the Omani official that any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences."
