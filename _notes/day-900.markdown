1. **ICE officials used facial recognition software to analyze state driver's license photo databases without motorists' permission**. ICE requested to comb through repositories of license photos in at least three states that offer licenses to undocumented immigrants. At least two of the states — Vermont and Utah — complied with the requests. In Washington State, agents authorized administrative subpoenas of the Department of Licensing to conduct a facial recognition scan of all photos of license applicants, but it's unclear whether state officials carried out the searches.

2. **Trump said he wants members of the press to "go in and see" inside the migrant detention centers**. "I'm going to start showing some of these detention centers ... to the press," Trump said. "We're going to send people in. We're going to have some of the press go in." Trumps comments come days after several Democratic members of Congress toured two facilities in Texas, where they found migrants and their children are being forced to live in squalid conditions while detained near the southwestern border.

* [📌 ](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/#1-a-report-from-the-department-of-ho)**[Day 895](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/#1-a-report-from-the-department-of-ho): A report from the Department of Homeland Security's independent watchdog found the squalid conditions at migrant detention camps were more widespread than initially revealed**. The report describes standing-room-only cells, children without access to showers or hot meals, and detainees desperately begging to be released. Inspectors visited five facilities in June, where they found many migrants are given only wet wipes to clean themselves and bologna sandwiches to eat, leading to additional health problems. Children at two of the camps were not given hot meals until inspectors arrived. Overcrowding was so severe that migrants were banging on cell walls and pressing notes up against the windows begging for help.

1. **The Justice Department has assigned a new team of attorneys to defend Trump's ongoing attempts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census**. A statement released by the DOJ on Sunday gave no clear reason for the change to the legal team, but experts say the team is likely to face questions on multiple fronts after the Trump administration spent the last 15 months giving conflicting explanations for why the question should be added. Trump recently ordered officials to keep pursuing the addition of the question, even if it means delaying the Constitutionally-mandated decennial survey.

2. **Billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005**. He is scheduled to appear in court in New York today, roughly 12 years after he effectively received a slap on the wrist for allegedly molesting dozens of underage girls in Florida. Epstein's alleged abuse of minors has been the subject of lawsuits brought by victims, investigations by local and federal authorities, and exposés in the press over the course of more than a decade. The new indictment will be unsealed today in Manhattan federal court and is expected to contain charges that Epstein sexually exploited dozens of underage girls by paying them cash for "massages" and then molesting or sexually abusing them in his New York City mansion or his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump is a long-time friend of Epstein's, and he had this to say about the billionaire pedophile in 2002: "I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
