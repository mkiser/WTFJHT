1. **The Trump administration is scheduled to begin mass raids to arrest thousands of members of undocumented families starting on Sunday**. The operation was previously postponed due in part to internal resistance from immigration officials.  The raids will be conducted by ICE agents over multiple days and will include "collateral" deportations, where ICE agents might detain any immigrants who happen to be in the area when a raid occurs, even though they may not have been the targets of the raid. Family members who are arrested together will be held at family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, but some may end up being placed in hotel rooms until their travel documents are ready. The raids will take place in at least 10 major U.S. cities and ICE agents will be targeting at least 2,000 immigrants who have been ordered to leave the country.

2. **Trump is expected to issue an executive order to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census**. Trump tweeted that he will hold a press conference this afternoon, where he is expected to discuss his latest efforts to add the question to the decennial survey. "The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today," Trump tweeted. "Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion, we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship." The administration is already printing census forms without the citizenship question after the Supreme Court ruled last month that the justification for adding the question given by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was inadequate and "contrived."

* **📌[Day 889](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/06/27/day-889/#1-the-supreme-court-blocked-the-citi): The Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question from being added to the 2020 census**. The court found that while the Department of Commerce had a right to reinstate the question, the administration provided a "contrived" justification for doing so. The Trump administration claimed the citizenship question was necessary to better comply with federal voting rights law, while critics argued it is an attempt to intimidate immigrant households. The Department of Commerce will now have to justify the addition of the question, which raises the question of whether the Trump administration will have enough time or the ability to add it before the forms have to be printed. The administration previously told the court that the questionnaire needed to be printed by the end of June. The Census Bureau found the question would reduce the response rate –especially in immigrant communities – and result in an estimated 6.5 million people not being counted.

1. **A senior military officer accused Trump's nominee for the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of sexual misconduct**. The officer says Gen. John Hyten subjected her to a series of unwanted sexual advances, including kissing, hugging, and rubbing up against her while she was one of his aides in 2017. She also said Hyten tried to derail her military career after she rejected his advances. The Air Force investigated her allegations against Hyten and found there was insufficient evidence to charge Hyten or to recommend any administrative punishment. "My life was ruined by this," said the officer, who asked to remain anonymous. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/08a297df36e947a7888fde64acebdec5))

2. **The Trump Organization cancelled a planned event with a Miami-area strip club at Trump's Doral, Florida golf resort** because the charity associated with the event dropped out after seeing press coverage about the event. "Now that the charity has removed its affiliation," a Trump Organization spokesperson said, "the event will no longer be taking place at our property and all amounts paid will be refunded." The director of Miami Allstars, a charity for underprivileged children, said he didn't pay much attention to the event until The Washington Post called him on Tuesday. After The Post published [an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/strip-club-to-host-golf-tournament-at-trump-resort-in-south-florida/2019/07/09/52a83504-a266-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html) about the event, Miami Allstars backed out.
