1. **Trump's threats of mass ICE raids and immigrant deportations failed to materialize on Sunday**, marking the second time Trump has threatened large-scale ICE enforcement actions that never came to be. Instead, many immigrants in cities where the raids were expected simply stayed inside their homes, while immigrant rights activists took to the streets to protest the threats of a roundup. ICE would not confirm any arrests, and neither would the immigrant rights activists. Many immigrant markets and shopping areas, however, saw reduced foot traffic and hushed economic activity as a result of the threatened raids.

2. **Trump is considering getting rid of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the administration's failed attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census**. Trump has expressed frustration with Ross in the past over failed trade negotiations, Ross' long-time personal friendship with Trump has saved him from the axe. Ross may still be in the clear now that Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned on Friday, but some White House officials expect Ross to be gone as soon as this summer. Trump is reportedly making calls to allies outside the White House and musing about replacing Ross.

3. **Trump tweeted on Sunday that four congresswomen of color should "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."** While he did not mention them by name, Trump was referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley. Trump claimed that the congresswomen "originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world," even though all four of the women are American citizens and three were born in the United States. While Republicans remained largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks, Democrats responded with uniform condemnation of Trump's racist remarks. Trump then doubled down on the attack later that night, criticizing Democrats for "sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion." He continued: "If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!"
