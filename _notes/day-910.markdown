1. **Trump tripled down on his racist calls for Rep. Ilhan Omar to "go back" to Somalia with a new crowd chant of "send her back" at his latest rally in North Carolina**. He also appeared to invoke the old "love it or leave it" slogan of the Ku Klux Klan. "If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it," Trump told the crowd. Trump spent more time during the rally focusing on the four congresswomen of color than he did on his opponents in the 2020 presidential race.
