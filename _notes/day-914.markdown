Trump complained that the "phony Democrats" in Congress "have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt," and again called for investigations into Hillary Clinton instead of himself and his campaign.

2. **A new study by the pro-immigration group New American Economy found that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and their children**. The same study also found that that number is growing, despite claims that immigration leads to lower wages and fewer jobs for American citizens. The Fortune 500 companies examined in the study brought in a combined $1.6 trillion in annual revenue last year, and they employed 13.5 million people. On average, the companies founded by immigrants also employed 11% more people than the Fortune 500 companies with non-immigrant founders.
