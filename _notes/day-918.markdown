1. **Active duty military personnel are now stationed inside Border Patrol facilities near the border, just feet away from the migrant adults and children they're tasked with monitoring**. The proximity could lead to violations of the 140-year-old federal law that prohibits active duty troops and military personnel from coming into direct contact with migrants or being used as law enforcement. Soldiers stand on elevated platforms throughout large rooms inside the facilities where detained migrants are held. Troops were originally assigned to the facilities to conduct periodic welfare checks of the migrants detained inside, but officials say that arrangement has evolved into a continual presence watching over them.

2. **Several U.S. Marines were arrested at Camp Pendleton, CA and charged with human smuggling and other offenses for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border**. The migrants in question told border agents they had agreed to pay the Marines $8,000 to take them north of the border to Los Angeles and eventually to New Jersey. The Marines could face charges in military or federal court. None of the Marines in question had served in support of the Southwest Border Support mission.

3. **A pro-Trump Republican congressional candidate aiming to unseat Rep. Ilhan Omar was charged with felony theft** earlier this year for allegedly stealing 279 items valued at $2,327.97 from a Target and $40 worth of goods from a grocery store. Danielle Stella was arrested near Minneapolis on January 8, where she says she "remembers arriving at Target to purchase items but nothing else" due to PTSD. She faces a punishment of up to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 if convicted. Stella says she is "not guilty of these crimes."

4. **The U.S. government will pay between $15 and $150 per acre to American farmers hurt by Trump's trade war with China**. The latest aid package will cost $16 billion, with farmers in the South posed to see higher rates than those in the Midwest. The assistance will be distributed beginning in mid-to-late August, and payment will be disbursed based on their geographic location instead of the crops they produce. "There were a number of factors from last year’s programs that we wanted to correct," said USDA Chief Economist Rob Johansson. Cotton farmers in the Mississippi Delta states are likely to benefit the most from this year's aid package. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-idUSKCN1UK2M7))
