1. **State prosecutors in New York City subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the company's role in hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal**. The investigation is examining whether any senior executives at the company filed false business records about the payments, which would constitute a state crime. The inquiry came from the district attorney's office and is still in the early stages, but it will focus on the $130,000 payment Michael Cohen made to Daniels, as well as the arrangement between Cohen and the National Enquirer to pay off former Playboy model Karen McDougal, a second woman who said she had an affair with Trump. The Manhattan DA separately subpoenaed American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer.

2. **China threatened to retaliate against Trump's latest surprise round of 10% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods**. The Chinese government accused Trump of violating his June agreement with President Xi Jinping to start up negotiations again and end the costly fighting over China's trade surplus. Trump's latest round of tariffs would effectively extend punitive duties to everything the U.S. imports from China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said that if the new tariffs go into effect, "China will have to take necessary countermeasures to resolutely defend its core interests."

3. **Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia for its use of chemical weapons in the 2018 attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter**. The Trump administration already imposed an initial round of sanctions last year, in accordance with a 1991 law. That same law requires the administration to impose a second round of sanctions if Trump cannot determine that the state in question has stopped using chemical weapons, which U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to do. Russia continues to deny their involvement in the attack on Skripal and his daughter.

4. **The last black Republican in the House of Representatives has decided not to seek reelection**. Rep. Will Hurd's retirement is the third from a GOP lawmaker in the past week and the ninth from a party incumbent. With Hurd gone, Sen. Tim Scott will be the last black Republican lawmaker in Congress. Hurd recently criticized Trump's racist attacks on four congresswomen of color last month: "When you imply that because someone doesn’t look like you," Hurd said, in telling them to go back to Africa or wherever, you’re implying that they’re not an American and you’re implying that they have less worth than you."
