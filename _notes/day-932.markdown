1. **The House Judiciary Committee is officially conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump**. "This is formal impeachment proceedings," said Chairman Jerry Nadler. The committee will decide by the end of the year whether to refer articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote. The committee has indicated in recent court filings that proceedings have begun, but this was the first time anyone from the committee said it out loud. Nadler says at the end of this process, the committee will "vote to vote articles of impeachment to the House floor. Or we won’t. That’s a decision that we’ll have to make. But that’s exactly the process we’re in right now."

2. **Trump walked back his statement that he was "strongly considering" commuting the 14-year sentence of the former Illinois governor who was convicted of essentially trying to sell Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat for personal gain**. A day after musing about commuting Rod Blagojevich's sentence, Trump was having second thoughts in response to pushback from conservatives and Illinois Republicans. Now, Trump says White House staff are merely "continuing the review of this matter." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/politics/trump-blagojevich.html))

3. **The main DOJ official responsible for the Trump administration's failed attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census is leaving the Justice Department**. John Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, says he wants to spend time with his family while "discerning next steps." Gore is currently facing allegations that he provided false testimony and concealed evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question.

4. **The State Department suspended a foreign affairs official in the energy bureau after his ties to a white nationalist group were revealed**. The State Department refused to name the official, but the Southern Poverty Law Center identified him as Matthew Gebert.
