1. **Trump said he is seriously considering ending birthright citizenship in the U.S.** for children of non-citizens and people who came to the U.S. illegally. Trump said it was "frankly ridiculous that someone can "have a baby on our land, you walk over the border, have a baby — congratulations, the baby is now a U.S. citizen." The Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States," which has consistently been interpreted by the courts to grant citizenship to most people born in the United States, regardless of the citizenship status of their parents.

2. **Trump said he wanted to give himself a Medal of Honor, but decided not to after being talked out of it by his aides**. Trump made the comment during a speech to the 75th annual national convention of American Veterans in Kentucky. "Nothing like the Medal of Honor," Trump said after praising WWII veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Woody Williams. "I wanted one, but they told me I don't qualify, Woody. I said, 'Can I give it to myself anyway?' They said, 'I don't think that's a good idea.'" Trump never served in the military and received five draft deferments, including four for college and one for bone spurs in his foot.

3. **Trump: "I am the chosen one."** While discussing his ongoing trade war with China, Trump pushed back against the notion that this is his trade war, instead blaming previous administrations. "This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago," Trump said. "Somebody had to do it." He then paused, turned his head to the sky and declared, "I am the chosen one."
