1. **The U.S. is preparing to send 150 troops to patrol northeastern Syria**. Trump announced a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria last December, but the new troop deployment is part of an expanding series of military and diplomatic steps the U.S. has taken in recent weeks to defuse tensions with Turkey, which opposes U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish fighters. The U.S. currently has around 1,000 troops in Syria.

2. **The Air Force sent crews to Trump's Turnberry resort in Scotland on up to 40 different occasions since 2015**. That number is much higher than previously known, and it represents the preliminary results of an Air Force review launched last week after news reports about Air Force sending crews to Trump's properties. The preliminary tally does not indicate how many of the stays at Trump properties occurred since Trump became president, but the Air Force significantly increased the number of stops in Scotland under Trump after signing a deal with the Prestwick Airport at the end of the Obama administration.

3. **Trump said he is not planning to name Mike Pompeo as national security adviser while also keeping him on as the Secretary of State**. Trump confirmed that he spoke to Pompeo about the idea, but said that Pompeo "likes the idea of having somebody in there with him, and I do, too." Trump said he has 15 other candidates in mind to replace John Bolton, who Trump fired as national security adviser earlier this week.

4. **Trump complained that energy-efficient light bulbs make him look orange**. Trump said it was one of the reasons we need to roll back environmental standards for manufacturing. "The bulb we are being forced to use, number one, to me, most importantly," Trump said, "the light’s no good I always look orange, and so do you. The light is the worst." He also complained that energy-efficient light bulbs are "many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb," which he says "worked very well."

3. **Biden incorrectly claimed that the Obama administration didn't separate families at the border**. The Obama administration did not separate families as a matter of policy, as the Trump administration did as part of its “zero tolerance” border policy in 2018, but separations occurred on a case-by-case basis for parents being prosecuted on more serious charges than illegally crossing the border or in cases when an adult was suspected of not being a child’s parent.
