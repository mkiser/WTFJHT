Trump also told Pelosi that he wasn't responsible for the whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress.

4. **Details from a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy are not likely to be verbatim or come from a recording of the call**. Instead, the "transcript" will likely be cobbled together from written notes taken by U.S. officials who listen in on the call. Rather than record the call, standard practice for calls between a president and a foreign leader is to have at least two or more note-takers from the National Security Council on the call, usually CIA officers.

Trump is also expected to bring up "his concerns about what he sees as some predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."
