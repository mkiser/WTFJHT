**More from the complaint:**

* **The whistleblower also raised concerns about how the White House handled records of the conversation**. The whistleblower identified multiple witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate their complaint.

* **Senior White House officials intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call with Zelensky** by placing them on a computer system that is directly managed by the National Security Council Directorate for Intelligence Programs.

* **White House officials told the whistleblower that they were "directed" by White House lawyers to "remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored"** and have it "loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature," even though the call "did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective."

* **The whistleblower describes Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as a "central figure in this effort,"** which includes attempts at "pressuring a foreign country to investigate the President's main domestic political rivals." The complaints also says "Attorney General William Barr appears to be involved as well."

1. **Trump's part-time envoy for Ukraine helped set up an introduction between Giuliani and Zelensky so they could talk about having Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son**. Ambassador Kurt Volker, who also worked at a lobbying firm that continued to represent the Government of Ukraine for almost two years after he started as special envoy, contacted Giuliani and put him "in direct contact" with a top adviser to Zelensky named Andriy Yermak. The two eventually met face-to-face in Spain. Giuliani says he never received a security clearance to meet with Yermak in Spain.

2. **The whistleblower who filed the complaint with the intelligence community's inspector general has agreed to testify about the complaint to lawmakers in Congress**, but only if acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire gives the whistleblower's attorney the proper clearances to accompany their client. "This is a reasonable request that the Committee strongly supports and expects your office to fulfill immediately," Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to Maguire. Lawmakers have not been told the identity of the whistleblower or where the complainant works in the government.
