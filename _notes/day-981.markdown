1. **The effort to conceal Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president was part of a broader attempt to prevent information about Trump's calls with foreign leaders from becoming public**. At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed. No evidence has shown that Trump ordered the calls moved to the more secure storage system, but he has consistently been fixated on preventing disclosures to journalists and his aides have spent a lot of time trying to limit who hears Trump's interactions with foreign leaders, as well as lawmakers, friends and anyone else Trump consults with.

2. **The White House knew about the whistleblower's complaint against Trump, even as the complaint was moving through a process meant to protect the whistleblower from retaliation**. The whistleblower, reportedly a CIA officer, first shared information about potential abuse of power by Trump and a subsequent White House cover-up with the top lawyer at the CIA via an anonymous process. That lawyer shared brought the issue to the attention of the White House and the DOJ, following standard procedures. Around the same time, he also filed the official whistleblower complaint. Lawyers for the whistleblower refused to confirm that he worked for the CIA and said publishing information about him was dangerous.

3. **More than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials signed a statement warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine represent a "profound national security concern."** The letter also calls for an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine "the facts." Many of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Former officials from the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security also signed the statement.

4. **A Kremlin spokesperson said Russia hopes the U.S. doesn’t release the transcripts of Trump’s conversations with Vladimir Putin like it did with the Ukrainian president's calls**. "We would like to hope that things won’t come to such situations in our bilateral relations, which already have plenty of quite serious problems," said Dmitry Peskov. He called the move to release the information "a rather unusual practice," and said that as a rule, "materials from conversations on the level of the head of state are considered secret or top secret."

5. **Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont on Thursday became the first Republican governor to endorse the impeachment inquiry against Trump**. Scott did not say he believed Trump should be impeached or removed from office. But he did say Congress should examine the full whistleblower report, and that it was appropriate for the House to proceed with the impeachment inquiry.
