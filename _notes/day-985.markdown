1. **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky** where Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. It is not unusual for the nation's top diplomat to join calls with foreign leaders, but Pompeo had not previously acknowledged his participation in the call. During an interview on Sept. 22, days before the White House released a summary of the call, Pompeo dodged questions about the call and the whistleblower complaint. He also argued against releasing the summary of the call and, when asked, said he was unfamiliar with reports about the substance of the call.

* **Fact check: Were whistleblower rules changed before Ukraine complaint?** "The law was not changed. What happened was a form was changed. A form cannot change the law," one attorney said.

1. **Both William Barr and Mike Pompeo personally participated in contacts between Trump and the leaders of at least four foreign leaders**. The goal those contacts was to produce stories that could damage Joe Biden or undermine the U.S. intelligence community's 2017 assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.

2. **Lawyers for the House of Representatives believe the grand jury redactions in the Mueller report show Trump lied about his knowledge of his campaign's contacts with WikiLeaks**. The attorneys made the suggestion in a court filing as part of the Judiciary Committees attempts to obtain the grand jury materials, which remain secret by law. The filing says the materials not only reveal Trump's motives for obstructing Mueller's probe, but "they also could reveal that Trump was aware of his campaign’s contacts with WikiLeaks." To back up their claims, the legal team cited a passage in Mueller’s report about Paul Manafort’s testimony where he "recalled" Trump asking to be kept "updated" about WikiLeaks’ disclosures of DNC emails.
