1. **Two men who worked with Giuliani to find damaging information about Biden and his son have been charged with conspiring to violate campaign finance laws that prohibit foreign nationals from contributing to U.S. campaigns**. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are two key subjects in the House's impeachment inquiry. They were indicted and accused of making "secret agreements" to hide the fact that they were laundering foreign money into U.S. campaigns through a range of corporate identities by using "straw donors" to make the contributions. Parnas and Fruman allegedly used the agreements to hide their scheme from candidates and federal regulators. The indictment alleges that on one occasion, they lobbied a then-sitting member of Congress at the request of "one or more Ukrainian officials."
