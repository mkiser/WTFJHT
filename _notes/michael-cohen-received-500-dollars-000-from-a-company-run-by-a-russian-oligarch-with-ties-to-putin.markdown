> **A shell company that Michael D. Cohen used to pay hush money to a pornographic film actress received payments totaling more than $1 million from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch and several corporations with business before the Trump administration**, according to documents and interviews.
>
> Financial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer and longtime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. **Transactions totaling at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January**, the records show.
>
> **Among the previously unreported transactions were payments last year totaling about $500,000 from Columbus Nova**, an investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch. A lawyer for Columbus Nova, in a statement Tuesday, described the money as a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Mr. Vekselberg.

> According to a dossier published by Avenatti on Tuesday evening, **“Vekselberg and his cousin Mr. Andrew Intrater routed eight payments to Mr. Cohen through a company named Columbus Nova** LLC beginning in January 2017 and continuing until at least August 2017.”
>
> The funds, Avenatti suggested, may have been used to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 hush payment made to Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump.

> Special counsel **Robert Mueller's investigators have questioned a Russian oligarch** about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments his company's US affiliate made to President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after the election, according to a source familiar with the matter.
>
> **Viktor Vekselberg**, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month **the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference**. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear.
