**Robert Mueller has asked the courts to begin the sentencing process for former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos**. Mueller has asked the judge to order an investigative report and move forward with sentencing process. The judge will ultimately decide what his sentence will be. Papadopoulos has been cooperating with the special counsel for months, but the move suggests that Papadopoulos' cooperation may no longer be necessary.
