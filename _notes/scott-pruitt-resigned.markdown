**Scott Pruitt resigned from the EPA** following months of controversies regarding his spending, ethics and management at the agency. Andrew Wheeler will take over as acting administrator. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/07/05/embattled-epa-chief-scott-pruitt-resigns/) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/395667-embattled-epa-head-pruitt-resigns))

> **I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency**. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!
