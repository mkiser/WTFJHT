* ***Nieman Lab featured Current Status today**, the political news aggregator I launched recently. Read the post [here](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/combine-an-editorially-responsible-algorithm-political-news-and-you-have-current-status/) and be sure to [check out Current Status](https://currentstatus.io/) if you haven't already.*

* *I built Current Status to help me source news for the daily WTF Just Happened Today updates. "I see my role as a sort of reinforcement editor, ensuring that the good stuff is always percolating to the top. Sometimes the news isn't as neat as an algorithm wants to make it."*

* *"Current Status, which describes itself as 'the political web's front page,' has been up and running for a couple of weeks now. The site updates several times an hour to provide a ranked view of the current top political news stories across, on average, more than 100 different publications."*
