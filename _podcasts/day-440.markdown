1/ Robert Mueller informed Trump's lawyers that the president is a subject of the special counsel's investigation, but Trump is not a target at this point. Targets of an investigation are people for which there is substantial evidence linking them to a crime, while subjects are simply under scrutiny. Subjects, however, can easily become targets due to their testimony or other factors. Mueller also reiterated his desire to interview Trump.

2/ A political appointee at the Department of Defense resigned after CNN revealed that he had posted birther conspiracies and other controversial things about Obama on social media. Todd Johnson is a former Trump campaign state director in New Mexico and joined the Defense Department in 2017. His job was to provide logistical support for the secretary's events and appearances.

3/ At least 18 email domains managed by the Executive Office of the President are not in compliance with a Department of Homeland Security protocol that verifies the emails. Of the 26 domains tested, only one had fully implemented the protocol, which means someone could have theoretically sent misinformation from a presidential aide's account.
