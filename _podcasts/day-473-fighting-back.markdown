**DEPT. OF THINGS RUDY GIULIANI SAID LATELY.**

* If Trump agrees to an interview with Robert Mueller, he could invoke his 5th Amendment right to protect against self-incrimination by refusing to respond to some questions.

* Trump is under no obligation to obey a subpoena, saying "we don't have to comply" with one.

* Giuliani is "focused on the law more than the facts right now," when it comes to Trump's legal situation.

* "People don't go away for $130,000," Giuliani said, calling the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels "a nuisance payment" rather than "a settlement" and that "People don't go away for $130,000."

* It's possible that Michael Cohen paid off other women for Trump, Giuliani said.

* Trump is "committed to" regime change in Iran, saying it's "the only way to peace in the Middle East" and "more important than an Israeli-Palestinian deal."

**NOTABLES.**

* Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee plan to release a trove of 3,000 Russian-linked Facebook ads later this week.

* John McCain told friends that he does not want Trump to attend his funeral and would like Mike Pence to come instead.

* Trump urged voters in West Virginia to vote against Don Blankenship in the Republican Senate primary.
