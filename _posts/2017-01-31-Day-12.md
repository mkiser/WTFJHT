1/ **Hill staffers secretly worked on Trump's immigration order.** Several House Judiciary Committee aides helped craft the controversial directive without telling Republican leaders. The news of their involvement helps unlock the mystery of whether the White House consulted Capitol Hill about the executive order, and confirms that the small group of staffers were among the only people on the Hill who knew of the looming controversial policy.

>  * **Draft executive order points to more immigration restrictions, focusing on protecting U.S. jobs.** The Trump administration is considering a plan to weed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance, as well as to deport — when possible — immigrants already living in the United States who depend on taxpayer help.

2/ **Obama’s protections for L.G.B.T. workers will remain.** The White House said Trump would leave in place a 2014 order that created new protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, pledging to protect the community from violence and oppression. It uses stronger language than any Republican president has before in favor of equal legal protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

* **How to build an autocracy.** The preconditions are present in the U.S. today. Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/how-to-build-an-autocracy/513872/))

* **Fox News' Sean Hannity: The media 'doesn't understand' Donald Trump.** By highlighting pundits and polls that dismissed Trump’s chances of winning the Presidency, Hannity argues, the “mainstream media” effectively delegitimized itself.
