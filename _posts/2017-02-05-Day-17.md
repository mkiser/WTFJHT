1/ **Appeals court rejects request to immediately restore travel ban**. A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump’s immigration order. The ruling meant that refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations would, for now, continue to be able to enter the country. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/us/politics/visa-ban-trump-judge-james-robart.html){:target="_blank"})

> **tl;dr**
>
> A judge in a lower federal court had put a temporary stop to the travel ban. Because the appeals court declined to intervene immediately, affected travelers can enter until at least until Monday. The appeals court set a schedule asking challengers to the ban to file a response by roughly 3 a.m. Eastern on Monday, and the Justice Department — representing the Trump administration — to reply to that by 6 p.m.
>
> Trump administration had said it was improper for a lower court to engage in "second-guessing" of President Trump’s controversial immigration order and asked the appeals court to dissolve the judge’s order that stopped its implementation.
