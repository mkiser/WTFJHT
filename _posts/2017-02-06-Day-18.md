2/ **After 2 weeks of stumbles, Trump and staff rethink tactics**.

5/ **The massacre that wasn’t, and a turning point for fake news**.

6/ **Trump is now speculating that the media is covering up terrorist attacks**. Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim: The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks and complicit in making terrorists successful.

_Related:_

* **Trump’s continued defense of Putin confounds Republicans**. Congressional Republicans have broken with Trump over dozens of controversial statements he has made during his campaign, his transition and now his presidency. But few issues appear to have confounded lawmakers as much as his consistent defense of Putin.

The 24-hour marathon of speeches is expected to conclude at noon on Tuesday, when the Senate is expected to vote on DeVos' confirmation.
