2/ **After 2 weeks of stumbles, Trump and staff rethink tactics**.

5/ **The massacre that wasn’t, and a turning point for fake news**.

6/ **Trump is now speculating that the media is covering up terrorist attacks**. Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim: The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks and complicit in making terrorists successful.

_Related:_

* **Trump’s continued defense of Putin confounds Republicans**. Congressional Republicans have broken with Trump over dozens of controversial statements he has made during his campaign, his transition and now his presidency.
