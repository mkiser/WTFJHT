1/ **9th Circuit Court of Appeals to hear challenge to Trump's ban today**. The issue in front of the court at the moment is whether the ban will remain suspended for now. The hour-long hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p.m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump's travel ban. The three-judge panel is expected to rule this week. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/politics/9th-circuit-court-of-appeals-trump-travel-ban/){:target="_blank"})
