1/ **Russia has secretly deployed a new cruise missile** despite violation of the arms control treaty that helped seal the end of the Cold War. The move presents a major challenge for President Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Putin and to pursue future arms accords. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html){:target="_blank"}) 

2/ **Trump knew Flynn misled officials on Russia calls for "weeks"** the White House says. The comment contrasts the impression Trump gave aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a report that revealed Flynn had not told the truth about the calls. White House counsel Don McGahn told Trump in a January briefing that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia.
