1/ **Donald Trump delivered a series of raw and personal attacks on the media in a news conference for the ages**. It was a return to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he used the media — and his supporters' distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn't just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn't), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked. There was a rawness to his attacks, a personal invective that seemed well beyond the typically antagonistic relationship that exists between the media and the president they cover. This was not a piece of political strategy. This came right from Trump's gut.

6/ **The Kremlin ordered state media to cut way back on their fawning coverage of Trump**, reflecting a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought.

8/ **ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse**.

**The White House has found ways to end protection for "Dreamers” while shielding Trump from blowback**. Trump's aides have examined at least two options for repealing DACA that would not directly involve Trump: a lawsuit brought by states, and new legal guidance that details who is a priority for deportation. Trump has repeatedly promised to end the program on “day one” of his presidency and called the protections “unconstitutional executive amnesty.” ([Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-daca-20170216-story.html){:target="_blank"})

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-signs-law-rolling-back-disclosure-rule-for-energy-and-mining-companies/2017/02/14/ccd93e90-f2cd-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html){:target="_blank"}) 

11/ **The Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list**. A Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act” unfolded just as supporters of the law had feared, with round after round of criticism from Republican lawmakers who said the federal effort to keep species from going extinct encroaches on states’ rights, is unfair to landowners and stymies efforts by mining companies to extract resources and create jobs.

13/ **More than 200 Republicans in Congress are skipping February town halls with constituents**. After outpourings of rage at some early town halls, many Republicans are opting for more controlled Facebook Live or “tele-town halls,” where questions can be screened by press secretaries and followups are limited.
