1/ **Pence met with open skepticism in Brussels**. "Too much has happened over the past months in your country, and in the EU,” Donald Tusk said, European Council President. “For us to pretend that everything is as it used to be.” Pence came to the European Union to reassure them that Trump actually supports the 28-nation bloc and that the US will continue its commitment despite the partial disintegration Trump has hailed. Pence was insistent that support for the alliance was a bedrock of US policy. But he demanded that other member nations scale up their defense spending to meet NATO's requirements, a longstanding request of US presidents that Trump has amplified.

* **Tusk asked Pence whether the Trump administration was committed to three things:** 1) maintaining an international order based on rules and laws, 2) whether Trump was committed to NATO, and 3) whether Europe could count “as always in the past, on the United States’ wholehearted and unequivocal, let me repeat, unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe.” Pence said “yes” to all three.

2/ **US Defense Secretary, James Mattis told reporters, "We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil.”** His comments are a departure from Trump who said, "We should have kept the oil. Maybe we'll have another chance.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/politics/mattis-baghdad-visit/){:target="_blank"}) 

3/ **Revised travel ban targets same seven countries** listed in Trump's original executive order and exempts travelers who already have a visa to travel to the U.S. The new draft also no longer directs authorities to single out — and reject — Syrian refugees when processing new visa applications. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/ap-source-trumps-revised-travel-ban-targets-same-countries/2017/02/19/e09c9ab2-f70a-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html){:target="_blank"}) 

4/ **Russia compiles psychological dossier on Trump for Putin**. Its preliminary conclusions is that Trump is a risk-taker who can be naïve. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-compiles-psychological-dossier-trump-putin-n723196){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Statisticians worry about alternative economic facts** and doctored data from the government if the economy turns sour. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to the Council of Economic Advisers, established in 1946 to provide presidents with objective economic analysis and advice. The fears about data manipulation arise from the nontraditional approach the Trump administration has taken to interpreting economic data. Trump has has repeatedly cast the “real” unemployment rate as far above the official rate, using figures that incorporate all those of working age who aren’t employed. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-20/trump-team-fosters-fears-he-ll-adopt-alternative-economic-facts){:target="_blank"}) 

6/ **More than 100 protesters across the country were fired after joining the “Day Without Immigrants” demonstration**. The protests were aimed at showcasing the impact immigrants have on the U.S. economy. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/employees-across-u-s-fired-after-joining-day-without-immigrants-n722991){:target="_blank"}) 

7/ **Trump's Navy secretary nominee on the verge of withdrawing**. Philip Bilden, a former Army Reserve military officer with little naval experience, has drawn resistance to his lack of familiarity with Navy issues and has encountered difficulty separating himself from his financial interests. The White House has publicly denied that Bilden is reconsidering his nomination.

8/ **White House confirms adviser reassigned after disagreeing with Trump**. Craig Deare was removed from his role as a senior adviser at the National Security Council's Western Hemisphere. Deare knocked the Trump administration's handling of Latin American policies during a speech and criticized the overall White House dysfunction ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/19/politics/craig-deare-white-house-trump/){:target="_blank"})
