1/ **Sean Spicer targets own staff in leak crackdown**. After becoming aware that information had leaked out of a planning meeting, Spicer reconvened his staff and told them to dump their phones on a table for a “phone check," to prove they had nothing to hide. Spicer also warned the group of more problems if news of the phone checks and the meeting about leaks was leaked to the media.

2/ **White House: Too early to say whether a special prosecutor should look into apparent election meddling by Russia**. The assessment comes as a growing number of Democrats are calling for Jeff Sessions, who was a key figure in Trump’s campaign, to step aside as the FBI and the Justice Department probe what happened.

3/ **Chris Christie tells GOP lawmakers to hold town halls: "You asked for the job.

5/ **The New York Times will run its first-ever advertising during the Academy Awards tonight** with a spot that appears to target the Trump administration titled "The Truth Is Hard."

6/ **Trump will be the first president in 36 years to skip the White House Correspondents Dinner**. The last president to not attend the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981.

8/ **Churches across the US are fighting back against Trump's mandate to ramp up deportations** with new sanctuary practices of their own: They've created a modern-day underground railroad to ferry undocumented immigrants from house to house or into Canada using private homes in their congregations as shelter.
