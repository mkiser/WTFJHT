1/ **Sessions met with Russians twice last year, but didn't disclose the encounters during his confirmation hearing** when asked about possible contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow.

* **Graham and McCain want answers on Sessions-Russia report**.

2/ **Trump defended his tumultuous presidency and asked Congress to put aside its “trivial fights” to help ordinary Americans** in his first speech. Trump reiterated a host of familiar themes from his campaign and called for unity to address a litany of issues that he says are plaguing the country. "The time for small thinking is over," Trump said. "The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action."

3/ **DeVos backpedals on remarks about historically black colleges due to a fierce backlash** after she called historically black colleges and universities “real pioneers” of school choice.

* **Trump delays signing new travel ban order**. The delay was due to a busy news cycle, and Trump wanted the new executive order to get its own "moment."

* **House Republicans announce only Republicans are allowed to see the new health care plan**.
