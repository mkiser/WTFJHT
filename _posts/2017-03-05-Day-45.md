1/ **Trump wants congressional probe of claims that Obama had him wiretapped during last year's election, but won't comment further**. Trump is "requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016," Spicer said. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/05/donald-trump-barack-obama/98774014/){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Senator: Intel panel to look at alleged wiretap**. Trump's unsubstantiated allegations that his predecessor ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower will become part of the committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

5/ **Schumer: "The president is in trouble."** The Senate minority leader said that Trump's Saturday morning allegations about Obama will be damaging to his presidency whether they are true or not and that "the president makes it worse with these tweets."

6/ **The Trump administration may be skirting its own ethics rules** by hiring of three former lobbyists to work in the White House.

7/ **Trump angry and frustrated at staff over Sessions fallout for stealing his thunder in the wake of his address to Congress**. "Nobody has seen him that upset," one source said, adding the feeling was the communications team allowed the Sessions news, which the administration deemed a nonstory, to overtake the narrative.
