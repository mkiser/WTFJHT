5/ **Kellyanne Conway: "I don't have any evidence" of Trump wiretapping claim**. Conway said that previous comments she made linking WikiLeaks' release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA's tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and smart TVs to Trump's claims were about "surveillance generally” and not meant to be taken as specific proof that his allegation was true.

* **Abrupt dismissals leave US attorneys scrambling**.
