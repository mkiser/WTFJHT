1/ **Trump wrote off $100 million in business losses to reduce his federal taxes in 2005**. Trump paid $38 million in federal income taxes on reported income of $150 million, an effective tax rate of 25%. By claiming losses from previous years, Trump was able to save tens of millions of dollars in taxes that he otherwise might have owed.

* **Trump and his wife Melania paid $5.3 million in regular federal income tax in 2005 – a rate of less than 4%**.

* **White House: Trump paid $38 million in taxes in 2005 on more than $150 million in income.** The White House put the information out ahead of an anticipated MSNBC news report about the returns. Trump had promised during the presidential campaign to release his returns -- which every presidential nominee in modern times has made into a precedent -- after the conclusion of a routine audit, but the White House has not spelled out when exactly that would be. More recently, aides have suggested that since he won the election, he would not release his returns.

* **Trump said it could take several years for health insurance prices to start to drop under the healthcare replacement plan** he is promoting, creating a rocky transition period that could pose a risk for members of Congress up for re-election next year and Trump’s own bid for a second term in 2020.

* **Conservatives’ reaction to CBO report casts doubt on GOP health plan’s viability**.

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conservative-lawmakers-continue-to-push-back-on-obamacare-plan/2017/03/14/f7331e70-08aa-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html){:target="_blank"})
* **Republican Rep. Peter Roskam: GOP healthcare bill "very much a work in progress."** Roskam voted for the plan just days ago in his position as a member of the House Ways & Means Committee, but has been drawing substantial fire in his district for his stance on health insurance.

4/ **The Trump administration slammed the CBO estimate that millions of people would become uninsured** under the Republicans' plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The CBO found that 14 million people would lose their insurance coverage by next year under the bill, with the number rising to 24 million over a decade.

([Politico](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/obamacare-uninsured-white-house-236019){:target="_blank"})
* **CBO: Defunding Planned Parenthood would lead to thousands more births**. Analysts estimate that excluding the women’s health organization from the Medicaid program for one year would affect low-income areas and communities without many health care options, leaving 15% of those people “without services that help women avert pregnancy.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/cbo-defunding-planned-parenthood-would-lead-to-thousands-more-births/){:target="_blank"})
* **Ted Cruz calls rising premiums "most troubling aspect" of CBO health care report**. “This is not the mandate that we were elected to fulfill,” Cruz said.

5/ **Secretary of State Rex Tillerson used an email alias to discuss climate change while he was CEO of Exxon Mobil**.

9/ **Breitbart turns up the heat on Paul Ryan, leaking audio of Ryan disavowing Trump.** “I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan says in an October conference call intended for House Republican members.

10/ **Trump is set to sign a sweeping directive to dramatically shrink the role climate change plays in decisions across the government**, ranging from appliance standards to pipeline approvals.
