1/ **Trump offers no apology for claim on British spying**. Trump has stuck by his unsubstantiated assertion that Obama ordered his telephone tapped last year despite across-the-board denials and wryly used Merkel’s visit to repeat his contention that the White House had nothing to retract or apologize for. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/europe/trump-britain-obama-wiretap-gchq.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Sean Spicer flatly denies that the White House apologized to the British government** over the allegations that a UK intelligence agency wiretapped Trump Tower. Spokesman for UK Prime Minister says Britain has received assurances that claims won't be repeated. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/17/politics/gchq-trump-wiretap-denial/){:target="_blank"})
* **Ryan, Senate Intel committee see no evidence of Trump wiretap**. Ryan said, however, that he still trusted Trump, and that the apparently false claims the President aired on Twitter would not damage the White House's credibility. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/16/politics/paul-ryan-wiretap-response/){:target="_blank"})

2/ **Britain’s surveillance agency says it's "utterly ridiculous" that it was involved in the Trump "wiretap."** The GCHQ – the British equivalent of the National Security Agency – usually remains tight-lipped on allegations, neither confirming nor denying claims. Not this time. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/17/britains-gchq-breaks-its-silence-to-slap-down-claim-it-was-involved-in-trump-wiretap/){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Spicer says Trump "stands by" unproven allegation that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump Tower**, quoting a report from Fox News alleging that Obama used British intelligence to gain access to transcripts of conversations involving Trump. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/16/spicer-says-trump-stands-by-unproven-allegation-that-obama-ordered-wiretapping-of-trump-tower/){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Rex Tillerson rules out negotiation with North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs** and said that the Trump administration might be forced to take pre-emptive action “if they elevate the threat of their weapons program” to an unacceptable level. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/asia/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nuclear.html?_r=0){:target="_blank"})

* **Tillerson says diplomacy has failed as North Korea warns of nuclear war** after 20 years of trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program have failed. ([Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-tillerson-north-korea-20170316-story.html){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Scientists brace for a lost generation in American research** after Trump's budget proposal calls for major cuts to funding for medical and science research. Private funding isn't enough to offset Trump's proposed budget cuts. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/trump-budget-cuts-science/519825/){:target="_blank"})

6/ **The GOP health care bill advances despite opposition from three conservatives on the panel**. The budget panel passed the American Health Care Act, which now heads to the House Rules Committee. The vote was 19-17. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-health-care-bill-advances-opposition-conservatives/story?id=46171740){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Secret Service laptop with Trump Tower floor plans and details on the Clinton email probe stolen from a Secret Service agent's vehicle in New York City**. In addition to the laptop, the thief made off with official Secret Service lapel pins -- *in case you wondering...* ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-laptop-trump-tower-floor-plans-details/story?id=46204467){:target="_blank"})

8/ **Trump affirms support for NATO but says member nations "must pay what they owe."** Trump said some NATO countries owe “vast sums” in dues, which is “very unfair to the United States” — an allegation that appeared based on an incomplete understanding of how the alliance is funded. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-welcomes-merkel-to-white-house-for-high-stakes-meeting-amid-friction-on-trade-refugees/2017/03/17/423e0146-0b2b-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html){:target="_blank"})

poll/ **Americans break with Trump on immigration policy**. 60% say the government's top priority should be a plan to legalize undocumented immigrants, and 9 in 10 support a bill to allow certain undocumented immigrants to become citizens. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/17/politics/poll-oppose-trump-deportation-immigration-policy/){:target="_blank"})
