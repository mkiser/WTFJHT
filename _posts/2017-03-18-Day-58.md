3/ **Tillerson calls the North Korea nuclear program an "imminent" threat while ruling out negotiations with the country**.

([Politico](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nuclear-threat-china-236216){:target="_blank"})

* **The Trump administration is prepared to scrap nearly a decade of U.S. policy toward North Korea** in favor of a more aggressive effort to eliminate the country’s nuclear weapons program. Whether that means pre-emptive action, which he warned was “on the table,” will depend a great deal on how China responds. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/asia/all-eyes-on-china-as-us-signals-new-tack-on-north-korea.html?_r=0){:target="_blank"})
* **Tillerson says "all options are on the table" when it comes to North Korea**. The Trump administration challenged China to do more to pull its ally North Korea back from the nuclear brink as Tillerson bluntly declared that the U.S. will do whatever is necessary to prevent a North Korean attack.

4/ **Trump seeks proposals for 30-foot-high, "physically imposing" wall at the Mexican border**. The request from Customs and Border Protection also said that wall designs should make it essentially impossible for a person to climb or gain access with a ladder.

5/ **Trump administration files notice that it will appeal the ruling against its second version of the travel ban**. The Justice Department filed papers in federal court in Maryland, setting up a new legal showdown in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-files-notice-it-will-appeal-ruling-against-second-version-of-travel-ban/2017/03/17/6fe4b33a-0b1f-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Trump optimistic on new health law**, saying he expects the House Republican health plan will be passed "substantially pretty quickly."

7/ **Trump seems to ignore Merkel's handshake request**. 
In the exchange, photographers gathered around Trump and Merkel in the Oval Office and suggested that the two leaders shake hands for the camera.

8/ **Rex Tillerson blocked reporters from his first diplomatic trip to Asia**, then defended the decision, saying “I’m not a big media press access person.

This time, however, the only one reporter that was allowed to join him was from the conservative Independent Journal Review, a website partly owned by a top adviser to Vice-President Pence. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/18/rex-tillerson-blocks-press-travel-asia){:target="_blank"})

9/ **Kellyanne Conway’s husband is set to lead the Justice Department’s civil division**. The job would put George Conway at the forefront of defending immigration executive orders and other lawsuits against Trump administration.
