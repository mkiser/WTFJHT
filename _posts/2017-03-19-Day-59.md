Richard Ledgett, deputy director of the NSA, said the idea that Britain had a hand in spying on Trump was "just crazy" and that "it belies a complete lack of understanding of how the relationship works between the intel community agencies, it completely ignores the political reality of 'would the UK government agree to do that?'"

9/ **Trump continues the use of Special Forces to keep war against the Islamic State and terrorist groups at arm's length**.
