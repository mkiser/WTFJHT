1/ **Nunes could be facing an ethics probe** after disclosing the existence of a foreign surveillance warrant. House Ethics Committee rules compel Congress to investigate any "unauthorized disclosure of intelligence."

2/ **FBI Director James Comey attempted to reveal Russian tampering months before the election**. Obama administration officials blocked him. Comey had pitched the idea of writing an op-ed about Putin's effort to influence the election. It would not have mentioned whether the FBI was investigating Trump’s campaign workers or others close to him.

3/ **The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked to question 20 people in its investigation into Russian interference in the election**. The bipartisan composure contrasts the House Intelligence Committee, where Representative Devin Nunes ties to the Trump White House have raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation.

5/ **Neil Gorsuch looks short of the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster.** This is as close to must-win as it gets for Trump and the GOP after last week's health care debacle and McConnell has guaranteed Gorsuch will be confirmed on April 7. If Democrats filibuster, McConnell will then need to whip 50 of his 52 members to change the rules unilaterally to end the filibuster by simple majority and allow Gorsuch’s confirmation.
