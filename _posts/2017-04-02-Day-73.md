1/ **Trump may have incited violence during a Lousiville campaign rally** a federal judge in Kentucky said. Trump's attorneys sought to have the case dismissed on free speech grounds. The judge noted that speech inciting violence is not protected by the First Amendment and ruled that there is plenty of evidence that the protesters' injuries were a “direct and proximate result” of Trump's words. Trump repeatedly said “get 'em out of here” before the protesters were shoved and punched by his supporters.

3/ **The United Nations warns that Americans’ right to protest is in danger under Trump.** At least 19 states have introduced measures that would criminalize peaceful protests, stiffen penalties for demonstrators who block traffic, and even allow motorists to run over and kill agitators as long as the crash was "accidental." The bills represent an “alarming and undemocratic” trend that could have a chilling effect on activism.
