1/ **The Republican health care proposal would undermine coverage for those with pre-existing conditions**. States could could opt out of requiring insurers to cover essential health benefits. As well as do away with requiring insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who is the same age. The result might be a market that is much more affordable for healthy people, but would become largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying for medical care.

2/ **Assad apparently "gasses" civilians days after Tillerson suggested he could stay in power**. In a series of airstrikes, helicopters dropped what is likely sarin gas in an attack on the city of Khan Sheikhoun – the signs of trauma suggest it's a nerve agent, like sarin. The Trump administration has shifted from their accommodationist tone, to blaming the Assad regime and Obama for the attacks.

4/ **Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of federal agreements with dozens of law enforcement agencies.** In an effort to improve relations between the police and the communities they serve, the Obama administration negotiated reform agreements with troubled police forces.

The sweeping federal review could affect consent decrees nationwide.

5/ **Trump revoked the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order** Obama put in place to ensure that companies with federal contracts comply with 14 labor and civil rights laws.

8/ **Trump urged investigators to scrutinize alleged spying on his transition team**.
