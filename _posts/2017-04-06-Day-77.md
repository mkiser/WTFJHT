1/ **Senate Republicans deploy the "nuclear option" to clear the path for Neil Gorsuch**. Republicans changed the Senate rules to bar filibusters of Supreme Court nominees, allowing Gorsuch's nomination to go forward on a simple majority vote. The rule change fundamentally alters the way the Senate operates and will likely lead to the elevation of ideologically extreme judges if only a majority is required for confirmation.

* **The legislative filibuster will be at risk now that the Senate has gone nuclear**. Since Mitch McConnell has loosened the rules for judicial nominees, he is certain to face intensifying pressure from conservative activists and Trump’s White House to do it again for legislation.

2/ **Democrats filibuster Gorsuch** after Republicans fall short of the 60 votes needed to end debate on the nomination and proceed to a final vote of Gorsuch.

* **The Senate is poised for a historic clash over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch**. Democrats are vowing to block a procedural vote to advance Gorsuch's nomination.

3/ **Devin Nunes temporarily steps aside from leading the House Intelligence Committee**.
