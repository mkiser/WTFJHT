1/ **Trump's had enough of the Bannon and Kushner knife fights in the media.** Fed-up and frustrated, Trump tells Bannon and Reince Priebus to "work this out" with Kushner. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/white-house-kushner-bannon-military-strike.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **Trump ordered Bannon and Kushner to sit-down and attempt to bury the hatchet**. The two have been feuding in the media over policy differences, with both accusing the other of planting negative stories in the media.

3/ **Bannon could be forced out unless he adopts a more cooperative approach**. Trump is planning a more inclusive style and "either Steve becomes a team player and gets along with people, or he'll be gone." Priebus would likely stay, however.

4/ **Twitter erupts over whether Trump should #FireBannon or #FireKushner**.

5/ **Trump's "America First" constituency is furious about the Syria strikes**. The conspiracy site Infowars called the nerve agent attack a “false flag” planted by the US deep state meant to force the country into a war. The now-furious supporters rallied around the hashtag #SyriaHoax to urge Trump to stay out of Syria. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/04/07/im-officially-off-the-trump-train-trumps-online-base-is-furious-about-the-syria-strikes/){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Warplanes returned to the Syrian town devastated by a chemical weapons attack to bomb them again**. There are no reports of chemical weapons being used this time. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/08/middleeast/syria-strikes-russia-donald-trump/){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Russia deploys warship to Mediterranean after US missile strikes**. The missile-armed frigate is headed toward the Syrian port of Tartus on a routine voyage.

8/ **Obama aides pushed back against criticism of inaction on Syria**, saying they proposed similar airstrikes in Syria, but were stymied by a Republican-controlled Congress.

9/ **Betsy DeVos' security detail is costing the Department of Education almost $1 million per month**. The US Marshals Service will provide protection for DeVos for the next four years and is hiring nearly two dozen people specifically to guard her. No other cabinet-level official is being guarded by federal marshals.
