2/ **The US is ready to launch a preemptive strike if North Korea is about to test a nuclear weapon**. North Korea has warned that a "big event" is near.

4/ **China warned that tensions on the Korean Peninsula could get out of control** and urged an end to “mutual provocation and threats.” North Korean military issued a statement threatening to attack American military bases in South Korea, warning that it could annihilate those targets “within minutes.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/world/asia/north-korea-china-nuclear.html){:target="_blank"})
