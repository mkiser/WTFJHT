1/ **North Korea parades new missiles in show of force, worrying analysts**. Pyongyang's military hardware includes a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which appears to have elements of two other ICBMS, the KN-08 and KN-14 missiles. The KN-08 has a theoretical range of about 7,500 miles, which is enough to reach all of the United States from North Korea. The KN-14 is also capable of reaching the US mainland, although it has a shorter range.

2/ **Trump's strategy on North Korea is to apply "maximum pressure and engagement."** The US is hopeful China and Russia will agree to tighter UN sanctions on North Korea if it conducts another nuclear test.
