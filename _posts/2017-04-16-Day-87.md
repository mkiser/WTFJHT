1/ **Trump "will take action" to end any North Korea threat to the US** and will not accept a hostile regime with nuclear weapons. While the administration is not planning to respond to the failed missile launch, Trump's national security adviser said the launch "fits a pattern of provocative and destabilizing and threatening behavior on the part of the North Korean regime."
