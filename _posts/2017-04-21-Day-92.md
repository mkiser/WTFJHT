1/ **The threat of a government shutdown hinges on the Mexican border wall and Obamacare funding**. Trump and Republicans will have four days to overcome intraparty ideological divisions and win over some opposition Democrats next week to pass a spending package to keep the government open beyond April 28.

Democrats have taken a hard line against any money for the border wall and insist that the measure include the Obamacare payments to insurance companies.
