1/ **People are marching for science because "there is no Planet B."** Scientists and “friends of science” are participating in the March for Science at the National Mall today, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of people. More than 600 satellite marches are scheduled across six continents to raise concerns about the erosion of the value of expertise, and the rise of pseudoscientific and anti-scientific notions.

* **For first time since the 1800s, Britain goes a day without burning coal for electricity**. Coal powered Britain into the industrial age and into the 21st century, contributing greatly to the “pea souper” fogs that were thought for decades to be a natural phenomenon of the British climate.

2/ **Trump vows to unveil a “massive” tax cut for Americans next week**, surprising Capitol Hill and leaving Treasury officials speechless. Trump said his tax reductions would be “bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever," but revealed no details about what is an enormously complicated effort to overhaul the nation’s tax code. The announcement is supposed to come Wednesday. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/politics/trump-order-takes-aim-at-tax-regulations-imposed-by-obama.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **The Trump administration claims NYC is "soft on crime." Data says otherwise.** Jeff Sessions said NYC "continues to see gang murder after gang murder, the predictable consequence of the city's 'soft on crime' stance" and is "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime." Since 1993, murder has decreased 82%, shootings have decreased 81%, and overall crime has decreased 76%.

5/ **Russian operatives tried to use Trump advisers last summer to infiltrate the Trump campaign**.

6/ **The US will "honor" the refugee resettlement agreement with Australia**, despite Trump previously calling it a "dumb deal." ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/22/politics/us-australia-pence-refugee-deal/index.html){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Trump asks Obama Surgeon General to resign**. Vivek H. Murthy has been replaced by his deputy, Rear Adm. Sylvia Trent-Adams, one of the first nurses to serve as surgeon general. It was not immediately clear why Dr. Murthy was relieved from duty. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/us/politics/surgeon-general-trump-administration.html){:target="_blank"})

8/ **The Florida state senator that unleashed an expletive-laden rant and racial slur resigns**.
