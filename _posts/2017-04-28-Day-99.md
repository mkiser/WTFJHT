2/ **Trump says a "major, major conflict" with North Korea is possible** over its nuclear and missile programs, but would prefer a diplomatic solution. The administration is preparing new economic sanctions, but has not taken the military option off the table.

3/ **North Korea released a propaganda video showing the White House in crosshairs and aircraft carriers exploding**.

4/ **House Republicans failed to round up enough votes for their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Again.** Revisions to the bill won over the Freedom Caucus this week, but those same changes drove away other members, including some who supported the first version.

5/ **The economy turned in the weakest performance in three years** as consumers slowed their spending. Gross domestic product grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/947c3bc5feb7424289a0aa2ab210e800/US-economic-growth-weakened-to-0.7-percent-in-first-quarter){:target="_blank"})

9/ **Trump’s original campaign manager is now promising to arrange meetings with Trump** and “key members" of the administration.

11/ **The NSA halts the collection of Americans' emails and texts due to compliance issues with FISA court rules**.

But, the NSA ended up collecting messages sent and received domestically as a byproduct. Oops.
