2/ **Trump says a "major, major conflict" with North Korea is possible** over its nuclear and missile programs, but would prefer a diplomatic solution.

4/ **House Republicans failed to round up enough votes for their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Again.** Revisions to the bill won over the Freedom Caucus this week, but those same changes drove away other members, including some who supported the first version.

5/ **The economy turned in the weakest performance in three years** as consumers slowed their spending. Gross domestic product grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter.

9/ **Trump’s original campaign manager is now promising to arrange meetings with Trump** and “key members" of the administration.

11/ **The NSA halts the collection of Americans' emails and texts due to compliance issues with FISA court rules**.
