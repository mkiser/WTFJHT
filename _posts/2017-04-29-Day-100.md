1/ **How Trump reshaped the presidency and how it's changed him**. In his first 100 days, Trump has transformed the highest office in ways both profound and mundane, pushing traditional boundaries, ignoring longstanding protocol and discarding historical precedents as he reshapes the White House in his own image. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/us/politics/trump-presidency-100-days.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **At 100 days, Trump’s big talk on the economy lacks substance**. Trump has tweeted a great game, but other than reversing some of Obama’s executive orders, he hasn’t really done much on the employment and economic fronts. Consumer confidence has risen, but it’s not clear what impact it will have on the economy. Or how long that optimism will last. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/at-100-days-trumps-big-talk-on-the-economy-lacks-substance/2017/04/28/dfb36de2-29fa-11e7-a616-d7c8a68c1a66_story.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Trump’s first 100 days ranked by the best, the worst, and everything in between.** Sizing up the milestone than with a ranking from best to worst, smooth to chaotic, squeaky-clean to scandalous, of all the president’s days in the White House so far. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/29/trumps-first-100-days-ranked-215083){:target="_blank"})

* **What mattered and what didn’t**. Trump has done more—and less—to change America than you think. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/26/trump-first-100-days-president-rating-accomplishments-215071){:target="_blank"})

4/ **In its first 100 days, the GOP scrambles to learn how to govern**. As Republicans reach the end of their first hundred days of controlling all the levers of power in Washington, they now acknowledge that being put in charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue has brought out the long-standing divisions within the party and tensions between the two houses of Congress. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/in-its-first-100-days-in-power-the-gop-scrambles-to-learn-how-to-govern/2017/04/28/8a33ffaa-2a84-11e7-a616-d7c8a68c1a66_story.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Congress at 100 Days: Frenetic action but few accomplishments**. The broad policy agenda that Republicans bragged that they would deliver if they won control in Washington has eluded them thus far, disenfranchise the minority party, and created one of the least productive opening acts by Congress in recent memory. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/congress-100-days-trump.html){:target="_blank"})

5/ **How the world sees Trump**. The number of campaign promises that have morphed into presidential U-turns is staggering. Allies and adversaries alike are trying to figure out whether a Trump Doctrine is emerging, or whether one even exists. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/29/politics/trump-world-leaders-image-100-days/index.html){:target="_blank"})

6/ **White House reporters recall their most vivid moments of Trump’s first 100 days**. Covering the Trump White House can be exhilarating, maddening, exhausting – but never boring. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/trump-white-house-first-100-days-new-york-times-reporters.html){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Inside Trump's tumultuous first 100 days**. Trump wraps up his first 100 days with the lowest approval rating of any president at this juncture since Dwight Eisenhower. That vulnerability is underscored by the willingness of even Trump’s closest GOP allies to critique his shortcomings. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/state/inside-donald-trumps-tumultuous-first-100-days/){:target="_blank"})

8/ **Trump's presidency has become the demoralizing daily obsession** of anyone concerned with global security, the vitality of the natural world, the national health, constitutionalism, civil rights, criminal justice, a free press, science, public education, and the distinction between fact and its opposite. ([The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/01/a-hundred-days-of-trump){:target="_blank"})

9/ **Trump has given progressives so many causes for fear and outrage**, it can be difficult — both practically and psychologically — to keep on top of them all as they happen. ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/every-terrifying-thing-that-donald-trump-has-done.html){:target="_blank"})

* **Trump has galvanized activists on the left, but can they stay energized?** Thousands of groups have sprouted across the country, aimed at resisting the Trump's agenda. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/trump-has-galvanized-activists-on-the-left-can-they-stay-energized/2017/04/28/4eaad81c-250e-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html){:target="_blank"})
* **The Women's March still inspires, but can the enthusiasm hold?** ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/28/525764938/100-days-in-womens-march-still-inspires-but-can-the-enthusiasm-hold){:target="_blank"})

10/ **A president's very public education**. Over the course of his 100 days in office, Trump has been startlingly candid about health care being complicated, China as an ally, NATO obsolescence, and that being president is hard. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/c83a048828fd4e1884fe897eca053717/Trump's-first-100-days:-A-president's-very-public-education){:target="_blank"})

## _WTF Happened Today:_


1/ **Trump is talking about consolidating his power**. In an interview with Fox News, he dismissed the “archaic” rules of the House and Senate — using that word four times — and suggested they needed to be streamlined for the good of the country. Also, he doesn't like the filibuster. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/29/trump-is-now-talking-about-consolidating-his-own-power/){:target="_blank"})

2/ **In defiance of international pressure, North Korea tests another ballistic missile**. The missile blew up over land in North Korean territory. It was the second consecutive failure in the past two weeks. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/world/north-korea-missile-launch/index.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **The People’s Climate March draws thousands in DC**. Rather than pushing for stronger climate action, organizers this year say they are fighting to preserve the gains that have already been made. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/28/thousands-to-assemble-for-sweltering-climate-march-saturday/){:target="_blank"})

4/ **The EPA removed its climate science site the day before march on Washington**.

([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/epa-trump-website-climate-change-peoples-climate-march){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Patagonia threatens to sue Trump over national monuments order**. Earlier in the week Trump ordered federal officials to review two decades of national monument designations, calling them “another egregious abuse of federal power.” ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/330788-patagonia-threatens-to-sue-trump-over-national-monuments){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Trump, again, derides Elizabeth Warren as "Pocahontas"** – a jab at her Native American ancestry. During the 2016, Trump suggested Warren was exaggerating or even lying about her background. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-again-derides-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas-n752621){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Trump proclaims May 1 is "Loyalty Day"** as a way to "recognize and reaffirm our allegiance to the principles" upon which America was built and express pride in those ideals. ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/28/trump-proclaims-may-1-as-loyalty-day.html){:target="_blank"})
