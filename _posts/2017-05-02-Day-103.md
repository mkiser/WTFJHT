1/ **House Republicans are floundering on the Obamacare repeal as 20 Republicans have now opposed the plan**. Paul Ryan can only lose 22 votes and still pass the bill. With the 20 lawmakers against the bill, GOP leaders would have to persuade almost every undecided lawmaker to support the legislation in order to reach the 216-vote threshold needed for passage. Republicans insist they're close. If only two more members come out as "No" votes, there will be no majority to pass the bill.

2/ **Trump: The US "needs a good shutdown" in September to fix the Senate "mess."** He's frustrated by Senate rules that require a 60 vote supermajority to approve most major legislation. Trump's solution is to either elect more Republican senators in the 2018 midterms, “or change the rules now to 51%" and scrap the legislative filibuster althogether. Congress is poised to approve a budget to fund the government through September, but it doesn't include several provisions sought by Trump, including funding for a border wall and language for stripping federal money from so-called sanctuary cities.

3/ **Hillary Clinton – describing herself as "part of the resistance" – criticized Trump’s conduct in office, his foreign policy, and for posting on Twitter**.

10/ **Pro-Trump farmers now worry he was serious about the NAFTA repeal**. Corn, soybean, and dairy farmers are worried that Trump's rhetoric could directly impact their narrow margins.
