The Senate panel first requested the documents on April 28.

1/ **Trump met with Putin’s top diplomats at the White House**. The talks came one day after Trump fired the FBI Director, who was overseeing an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sergey Lavrov met with Rex Tillerson earlier in the day and sarcastically acknowledged the dismissal of James Comey by saying "Was he fired? You're kidding. You're kidding." The Kremlin said Trump's firing of Comey will have no effect on bilateral relations between the two countries. Trump also met with Sergey Kislyak, a key figure in the Flynn investigation.

2/ **Trump defended firing Comey and said both parties will thank him in an early morning tweetstorm**. Trump justified dismissing Comey, saying Democrats and Republicans had lost faith in his leadership due to "scandals." Trump then mocked his critics and suggested that a Democratic senator be investigated after appearing on TV condemning the president’s action. Later, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Comey was dismissed because he committed “atrocities” and that Trump had been considering the decision to fire Comey before his inauguration. Putin weighed in, saying the firing will have "no effect" on US-Russia relations and that Trump acted in accordance with the US law and Constitution. Thanks Putin!
