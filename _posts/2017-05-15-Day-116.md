1/ **Trump is considering a "huge reboot"** that could take out everyone from Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, to counsel Don McGahn and Sean Spicer. Trump is irritated with several Cabinet members and "frustrated, and angry at everyone." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-trump-irked-at-cabinet-and-staff-mulls-sweeping-shake-up-2407137307.html))

2/ **Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian diplomats during their Oval Office meeting last week**, which has jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State. Trump’s decision to disclose information risks cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. A US official said Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html))

3/ **Senate Republicans are looking at steep cuts to Medicaid that could drop millions of people from coverage** and reduce programs for the poor. Under pressure to balance the budget, Republicans are considering slashing more than $400 billion in spending on food stamps, welfare, and even veterans’ benefits through a process to evade Democratic filibusters in the Senate. If the Medicaid cutbacks get passed by both chambers, it could significantly scale back the federal-state insurance program that covers 73 million low-income or disabled Americans and shift significant costs onto hospitals and states.

4/ **James Clapper said that US institutions are under assault from Trump** and warned that federal checks and balances are eroding.

* **Republicans and Democrats agree that if Trump has tapes, he’ll need to turn them over to Congress**. Lawmakers from both parties said any White House recordings must be preserved for congressional review and that “it’s probably inevitable” that they would be subpoenaed.

5/ **North Korea successfully test-fired a new type of ballistic missile**, signaling an advance in their development of an intercontinental ballistic missile program. North Korea said the new "medium long-range" missile is capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead, warning that the United States’ military bases in the Pacific were within its range. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/world/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-launches-possible-ballistic-missile-south-korean-news-agency-reports-1494713029) / [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-idUSKCN18A12B) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/b4c2baf162034bfc9194691f2d1507b8/North-Korea:-New-long-range-missile-can-carry-heavy-nuke))

6/ **The 9th Circuit Court will hear the travel ban appeal, again**. A three-judge panel will hear a challenge to a Hawaii judge's decision to halt travel ban 2.0. Lawyers at the Justice Department must convince at least two of the judges to ignore Trump's record of campaign calls to ban Muslims from entering the US. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/9th-circuit-travel-ban-hearing-round-two/))

8/ **The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to reinstate North Carolina’s voter identification law**, which a lower court said targeted African-Americans “with almost surgical precision.” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a statement noting that there was a dispute about who represented the state in the case and that nothing should be read into the court’s decision to decline to hear it. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/14137a2d20cf4595a5121c9298b47c46/Supreme-Court-rejects-appeal-over-NC-voter-ID-law) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/15/supreme-court-leaves-in-place-a-ruling-that-struck-down-ncs-voter-id-law-238392) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/voter-id-laws-supreme-court-north-carolina.html))

9/ **The Dakota Access pipeline has its first leak**. The $3.8bn oil pipeline is not yet fully operational, but managed to spill 84 gallons of crude oil. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/10/dakota-access-pipeline-first-oil-leak))

10/ **White Nationalist Richard Spencer led a torch-bearing group protesting the sale of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Virginia**. The group chanted “You will not replace us." Spencer added: “What brings us together is that we are white, we are a people, we will not be replaced." ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/14/528363829/richard-spencer-leads-group-protesting-sale-of-confederate-statue) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/alt-rights-richard-spencer-leads-torch-bearing-protesters-defending-lee-statue/2017/05/14/766aaa56-38ac-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html))

11/ **Trump thinks that exercising too much uses up the body’s "finite" energy**. Trump mostly gave up athletics after college because he “believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-thinks-that-exercising-too-much-uses-up-the-bodys-finite-energy/2017/05/12/bb0b9bda-365d-11e7-b4ee-434b6d506b37_story.html))

12/ **Comey said he'd be willing to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, but wants it to be in public**. Comey originally declined an invitation from the committee to be interviewed in a closed-door hearing. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/trump-threatens-retaliation-against-comey-warns-he-may-cancel-press-briefings.html))

13/ **Syria is using a crematorium to hide executions, the State Department said**. The US believes Syria's "building of a crematorium is an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place in Saydnaya prison." A State Department official said the regime could be killing as many as 50 detainees a day. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/assad-syria-crematorium/) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/syria-is-secretly-executing-detainees-and-burning-the) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-accuses-syria-of-mass-executions-and-burning-bodies/2017/05/15/b7b66c86-3986-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html))
