1/ **Trump asked James Comey to shut down the Michael Flynn investigation** in a February memo he wrote shortly after meeting with Trump. "I hope you can let this go," Trump told Comey. The request is the clearest evidence that he tried to directly influence the Justice Department and FBI investigations. Comey kept detailed notes of his meetings with Trump, documenting what he perceived as improper efforts to influence a continuing investigation. An FBI agent's notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations.

2/ **Trump defended his decision to share ISIS intelligence with Russia**, tweeting that he had an "absolute right" to do so in the interest of fighting terrorism. Trump's tweets undercut his administration's effort to contain the report, where Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, and the deputy national security adviser for strategy all called the report that Trump revealed highly classified information to Russia false. The information was considered so sensitive that US officials had not shared it widely within the government or among allies.

3/ **McMaster backs Trump's sharing of sensitive intelligence with Russians: "It is wholly appropriate for the president to share whatever information he thinks is necessary."** He added that Trump "wasn't even aware where this information came from. He wasn't briefed on the source or method of the information either." McMaster refused to confirm whether the information the president shared with the Russians was highly classified.

4/ **Israel was the source of ISIS-related intelligence that Trump shared with Russia last week**. Two Israeli officials said that the intelligence shared by Trump "syncs up" with intelligence that shared with its US counterparts.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/world/middleeast/israel-trump-classified-intelligence-russia.html) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/israeli-official-trump-sharing-intelligence-with-russia-is) / [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/israel-was-source-intelligence-trump-shared-russia-sources-n760301) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-trump-shared-with-russia-was-from-israel-officials-say-1494960259))

6/ **Republican and Democratic lawmakers to Trump: hand over the transcript of the meeting with the Russians**. Members of Congress have spent several days demanding that Trump turn over tapes of White House meetings after he suggested that he records his conversations. Those calls intensified after Trump acknowledged on Twitter that he had shared sensitive information during his meeting with the Russians. White House aides have neither confirmed nor denied the possibility that Trump records his conversations at the White House. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/lawmakers-to-trump-turn-over-transcript-of-meeting-with-russians/2017/05/16/e9b6deb6-3a3d-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html))

* **Lawmakers express shock and concern about Trump disclosure of classified information**. "They are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening," the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said of the Trump administration. "The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think makes â€” it creates a worrisome environment." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/lawmakers-express-shock-and-concern-about-trump-disclosure-of-classified-information/2017/05/15/d0d6f8be-39b5-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html))

9/ **Paul Manafort took out a $3.5 million mortgage and never paid taxes on it**.

([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/manafort-got-3-5m-mystery-mortgage-paid-no-tax-n759866))

10/ **Trump to meet with Turkey's president amid differences** over the Trump administration's plan to directly arm Kurdish rebels in Syria for the fight against ISIS. Turkey considers the group a terrorist organization, because it maintains ties with a Kurdish revolutionary group inside Turkey. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-meet-turkeys-president-amid-sharp-differences-tensions/story?id=47431917))

11/ **Gingrich urged Trump to shut down White House press room** in order to send a message to the country "that the media is a corrupt institution and [Trump] is tired of being harassed by people whose only interest is making him look bad."
