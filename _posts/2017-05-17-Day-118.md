1/ **Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Bob Mueller to oversee the investigation of Russian interference in election**. Mueller will take command of the prosecutors and FBI agents who are working on the far reaching <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a>. Trump said that he expects the probe will find no collusion between his 2016 White House campaign and foreign countries, calling the Russia inquiry a “taxpayer-funded charade."

2/ **The House majority leader told colleagues last year: "I think Putin pays" Trump**. Paul Ryan told them not to leak the remarks and swore them to secrecy. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-majority-leader-to-colleagues-in-2016-i-think-putin-pays-trump/2017/05/17/515f6f8a-3aff-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html))

3/ **Jason Chaffetz asked the FBI to turn over all documents it has on Trump and Comey's conversations**. The FBI has until May 24 to produce the records before the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee subpoenas them. Chaffetz said that if the [memo](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/16/Day-117/#1-trump-asked-james-comey-to-shut-do) exists and accurately reflects the conversation, "that seems like an extraordinary use of influence to try to shut down an investigation being done by the FBI."

* **Comey’s memos were a product of a culture of note-taking**. It is standard for people who work in law enforcement to keep detailed phone and meeting logs. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/james-comey-memos-fbi-culture.html))

4/ **Senate and House Republicans and Democrats want Comey to testify** about his interactions with Trump, including whether Trump tried to obstruct the criminal probe into Michael Flynn. The collective political fallout from the past week “will make it difficult” for Republicans to resist a change in approach, Representative Charlie Dent said. "I think we need to hear from him as soon as possible in public to respond to the issues that have been raised in recent days," Mitch McConnell said. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/trump-comey-testify-congress-reaction-238496) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/hill-republicans-show-growing-concern-over-trump-controversies/2017/05/16/57dd4f14-3aad-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html) / ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcconnell-calls-for-james-comeys-testimony-1495043315))

* **The Senate Intelligence Committee requested that James Comey testify publicly** in the wake of his firing by Trump. Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner sent a letter asking Comey to testify before their panel in both open and closed sessions. The senators had previously asked Comey to testify in a closed session, but he declined. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/senate-intelligence-committee-leaders-demand-comey-memos-238504))

5/ **Democratic congressman Al Green called for "the impeachment of the President of the United States of America for obstruction of justice."** Green said it was the House of Representative's "duty" to take up impeachment. More Republicans and Democrats are starting to talk of the possibility that Trump could face impeachment after reports that he pressed James Comey to end an investigation of Michael Flynn. Representative Justin Amash said if the reports about Trump's pressure on Comey are true, it would merit impeachment. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both raised concerns about Trump’s action, but avoided the topic of impeachment in their statements responding to the news of Comey’s memo. “At best, President Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power," Pelosi said. "At worst, he has obstructed justice." Democrats can't impeach Trump without significant Republican support.

6/ **Republicans blocked the Democrats attempt to force a vote on creating a bipartisan congressional commission to investigate Russian interference**, how the intelligence community handled the matter, and the Trump administration's involvement. “You’re watching an obstruction of justice investigation developing in real time,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "If there were ever any question about the need for an independent special prosecutor, this report is the nail on the argument." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/republican-senate-mcconnell-white-house.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/hill-republicans-show-growing-concern-over-trump-controversies/2017/05/16/57dd4f14-3aad-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html) / [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKCN18D1XT))

* **Calls grow for an independent investigation**. The deputy Republican whip Adam Kinzinger switched his position for an independent commission or special prosecutor to investigate possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia, saying the recent news reports had marked a turning point for him. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/paul-ryan-we-need-facts-russia-investigation-n760756) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/trump-comey-and-russia-how-key-washington-players-are-reacting/kinzinger-r-shifts-calls-for-independent-commission-to-get-answers/))

7/ **Paul Ryan tried to contain the political fallout from the Comey memo by urging members to avoid "rushing to judgment."** He called himself "a person who wants to get the facts" and said that "there are some people out there who want to harm the president."

8/ **McCain compares Comey memo about his meeting with Trump to Watergate**. "The only thing I can say is I think we’ve seen this movie before. I think it's reaching the point where it's of Watergate size and scale," McCain said. His advice to Trump is "the same thing that you advised Richard Nixon, which he didn’t do... get it all out... it’s not going to be over until every aspect of it is thoroughly examined and the American people make a judgment. And the longer you delay, the longer it’s going to last." ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-republican-senator-invokes-watergate-scandal-comey-memo/story?id=47459550) / [The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/05/16/mccain-trump-scandal-has-hit-watergate-size))

9/ **Putin offers to provide Congress with the transcript to prove Trump didn't pass Russia secrets**, turning up the pressure on the White House to provide its own transcript of the meeting. Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trump's meeting with Lavrov, if the Trump administration deemed it appropriate. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin-idUSKCN18D1EA) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/europe/trump-putin-russia.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/russia-us-trump-lavrov-intel/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-offers-to-provide-congress-with-details-of-trump-disclosures-to-russian-envoys/2017/05/17/80485ffe-3af6-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html))

* **Senator Susan Collins says Trump needs to "right the ship"** and get his "house in order" because "we cannot have this constant chaos" every single day from him. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/kfile-susan-collins-constant-chaos/index.html))

10/ **Trump provided Russia with secrets so sensitive that news organizations are being asked not to report it**. Trump told the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador that the Islamic State had used stolen airport security equipment to test a bomb that could be hidden in electronic devices. US intelligence officials have asked media organizations not to report on the type of equipment, where it was stolen, and the name of the city where the intelligence was gathered. The intelligence has led to the new rules banning electronic devices in the cabins of certain flights.

12/ **Sally Yates disputed Sean Spicer's characterization of her warnings that Flynn could be open to blackmail by Russia as a "heads up."** Yates said she expected the White House to act urgently on the information that Flynn had been compromised by his contact with Russian officials prior to Trump's inauguration.

13/ **Members of the Turkish president’s security team breached police lines and attacked protesters** outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in the US. About two dozen demonstrators showed up outside of embassy hours after Erdogan met with Trump and a brawl erupted when Erdogan’s security detail attacked protesters carrying the flag of the Kurdish PYD party. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/politics/anti-erdogan-protest-washington-turkish-embassy/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/17/erdogans-bodyguards-in-violent-clash-with-protesters-in-washington-dc) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/turkish-embassy-protest-dc.html))

14/ **The Iran nuclear deal will remain as Trump imposes new penalties over its ballistic missile program**. The new sanctions is the latest attempt by the administration to signal its displeasure with Iran while not jettisoning the 2015 nuclear deal. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/iran-sanctions-trump-status-238507) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html))

16/ **Trump has turned to Corey Lewandowski, Jason Miller, and David Bossie as scandals pile up**. The former campaign aides have slid back into his group of advisers as a steady stream of damaging leaks and critical blind quotes that have flowed out of the West Wing. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/trump-scandals-miller-bossie-lewandowski-238520))

17/ **Trump’s education budget calls for deep cuts to public school programs in pursuit of school choice**. Funding for college work-study programs would be cut in half, public-service loan forgiveness would end, and hundreds of millions of dollars that public schools could use for mental health and other services would vanish under the plan, which cuts $10.6 billion from federal education initiatives. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trumps-first-full-education-budget-deep-cuts-to-public-school-programs-in-pursuit-of-school-choice/2017/05/17/2a25a2cc-3a41-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html))
