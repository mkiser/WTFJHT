1/ **Trump called Kim Jong Un a "madman with nuclear weapons,"** days before stating publicly that he would be "honored" to meet with Kim. In an April 29 call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Trump asked for his input on whether Kim is "stable or not stable." Duterte has been accused of presiding over the extrajudicial killing of thousands of drug dealers and users.

2/ **The US has two nuclear submarines off the coast of North Korea**, Trump told Duterte during last month's call. He revealed that “we have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all."

3/ **The Pentagon is in shock that Trump told Duterte about the submarines**. The Pentagon never talks about the location of submarines on the belief that stealth is key to their mission.

4/ **Trump congratulated Duterte for doing an "unbelievable job" in his war on drugs**, where the government has allowed extrajudicial killing for drug dealers and users. "You are a good man," Trump told Duterte. "Keep up the good work." The State Department’s human rights report calls the Philippines "disregard for human rights and due process" one of the "most significant human rights problems."

5/ **Pope Francis urged Trump to meet US commitments on climate change**. He gave Trump copy of his 2015 encyclical (a type of papal document used for significant or important issues) calling for urgent, drastic cuts in fossil-fuel emissions. Trump has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

7/ **The House Intelligence Committee will subpoena Michael Flynn** after he declined to appear before the panel.

8/ **Trump lawyers up and retains Marc Kasowitz for the Russia investigation**.

9/ **Trump's hotels are failing to track payments received from foreign governments** despite his promise to donate all profits back to the Treasury.

The Senate has already said it will make substantial changes to the measure passed by the House.

([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-mcconnell-exclusive-idUSKBN18K2FD))

12/ **Ben Carson called poverty "a state of mind."** He said he believes that government can provide a "helping hand" for people to climb out of poverty, but warned against programs that are "sustaining them in a position of poverty."
