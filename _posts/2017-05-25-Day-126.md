1/ **Trump's prepping for a years-long war under the cloud of a special investigation**. The White House is "getting street fighters ready to go" with legal, surrogate, communications, and rapid-response teams as part of a "new normal." With Trump on tour in the Middle East and Europe, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus are at home, putting in place the means to keep his agenda moving ahead and avoid "paralysis." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trumps-street-fighters-2421476130.html) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/25/russia-white-house-staff-238802))

2/ **Trump chastises "obsolete" NATO about how it's "not fair" some members don't pay their share**. He lectured 23 of the 28 member for what he called their "chronic underpayments" to the military alliance. The mutual defense pledge requires nations to contribute at least 2% of their GDP. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-blasts-nato-allies-paying-fair-share/story?id=47608155) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/europe/donald-trump-eu-nato.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-told-in-brussels-that-west-should-focus-on-values-not-only-interests/2017/05/25/7aa1865c-40cd-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html))

3/ **A federal appeals court will not reinstate Trump’s revised travel ban**, saying it "drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination." The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, saying the executive order violated the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion – In this case singling out Muslims. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-blocked.html) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/25/appeals-court-keeps-block-on-revised-trump-travel-ban-238834))

4/ **Macron out-Trumps Trump in "fierce" handshake duel**. _Editor's note: The descriptions are too good to summarize, so I'm quoting in full:_

_From the Washington Post:_ "...the two men shook hands for six long seconds. Their knuckles turned white, their jaws clenched and their faces tightened. Trump reached in first, but then he tried to release, twice, but Macron kept his grip until letting go." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/25/trump-and-french-president-macron-get-to-know-each-other-with-a-fierce-handshake/))

_From Bloomberg:_ "Trump’s trick is to go in strong and then hold on just slightly too long, often pulling the other man toward him. Meeting Macron for the first time before a NATO summit in Brussels, Trump went in firm as usual. But this time, it was Trump -- not Macron -- who tried to back out first. Macron simply wouldn’t let go as Trump tried to pull back once, and then flexed his fingers straight to get out. On the second try, he was able to pull away." ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-25/macron-out-trumps-trump-in-handshake-duel-before-nato-summit))

5/ **A group of 22 Republican senators are urging Trump to exit the Paris climate deal**. They say the provisions in the Clean Air Act and the Paris agreement would create "significant litigation risk," which puts fully rescinding the Clean Power Plan in danger. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-top-republican-senators-urge-trump-to-exit-paris-climate-deal-2421530161.html))

6/ **Paul Manafort remained in contact and continued to advise the Trump team even after the FBI launched its Russia probe**. Manafort called Priebus a week before the inauguration to tell him the dossier by a former British spy that alleged Russia had compromising information on Trump and his associates was "garbage." Manafort was forced to resign as Trump’s campaign chairman due to his ties to Kremlin-aligned politicians in Europe. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/25/manafort-trump-russia-advise-238803))

* **Russians had discussed how to influence Trump advisors last summer**. Specifically, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who both had close ties to Russia. It's unclear if Russian officials attempted to influence either. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/russia-trump-manafort-flynn.html))

7/ **Sessions was advised not to disclose his meetings with Russian officials when he applied for security clearance**. Democratic lawmakers are demanding for Sessions’s resignation. "He’s lied under oath," Senator Kamala Harris said. "He’s misled on security clearance forms. It’s simple — he should not be the Attorney General." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia.html))

9/ **A Montana GOP House candidate was charged with assault after "body-slamming" a journalist**. Greg Gianforte grabbed the reporter by the neck with both hands, slammed him into the ground, and then began punching the reporter. Misdemeanor charges were filed against Gianforte, who was "sick and tired of this!" – "this" being a question. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/24/greg-gianforte-bodyslams-reporter-ben-jacobs-montana) / [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/24/greg-gianforte-fox-news-team-witnesses-gop-house-candidate-body-slam-reporter.html))

11/ **Lieberman withdraws from consideration for FBI Director job**. Once considered the front-runner to replace James Comey, he's formally withdrawn citing the appearance of a conflict of interest now that Trump’s tapped his boss, attorney Marc Kasowitz, as outside counsel in the Russia investigation. ([Wall Street Journal](https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/05/25/lieberman-withdraws-from-consideration-as-fbi-director-citing-appearance-of-conflict-of-interest/?mod=e2twp) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/25/joe-lieberman-withdraws-trump-fbi-director-238824) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-lieberman-takes-running-fbi-director-citing-conflict/story?id=47607430))
