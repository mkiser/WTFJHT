1/ **Senate Republicans’ are aiming for a vote on their Obamacare repeal by the Fourth of July recess**. Republican leaders are faced with two choices: craft a bill that can get 50 votes, or bring up a bill they know will fail in order to end the health care debate and move on to tax reform, demonstrating that Republicans are too divided. They're prepared to take a failed vote on the Obamacare repeal in order to "show them a body" and bring the seven-year quest to a definitive end.

2/ **Trump's frustration with Jeff Sessions grows**, blaming him for the "watered down, politically correct version" of the travel ban. He's also upset with Sessions' decision to recuse himself from investigations related to the Russia probe. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/us/politics/trump-discontent-attorney-general-jeff-sessions.html))

3/ **Eric Trump called the Trump-Russia collusion allegations the "greatest hoax of all time."** He added that the investigation into possible coordination between his father’s presidential campaign and the Kremlin’s election meddling was a "witch hunt." ([The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-trump-trump-russia-probe-greatest-hoax-of-all-time) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-sons-expansion-mid-market-hotel-chain-politics/story?id=47855372))

4/ **Donald Trump shifted money from Eric Trump's kids cancer charity into his business**. Eric Trump's charity golf event was supposed to use his family's golf course for free with most of the other costs donated, but the Trump Organization billed the charity for more than $1.2 million for its use. Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament. The "maneuver would appear to have more in common with a drug cartel's money-laundering operation than a charity's best-practices textbook."

5/ **The contractor that leaked classified NSA documents on Russian hacking was charged by the Justice Department**. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, is accused of "removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet." She [leaked a top-secret NSA report](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/05/Day-137/#1-a-top-secret-nsa-report-shows-russ) showing that Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one US voting software supplier last year. Winner faces up to 10 years in prison for leaking classified information.

6/ **The Russian attacks on the election systems were broader** and targeted more states than those detailed in [yesterday's leaked intelligence report](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/06/05/Day-137/#1-a-top-secret-nsa-report-shows-russ). The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said, "I don't believe they got into changing actual voting outcomes."

8/ **Scott Pruitt falsely claimed that "almost 50,000 jobs" have been added in coal**.

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/06/06/pruitts-claim-that-almost-50000-jobs-have-been-gained-in-coal/))

9/ **Trump took credit for the $110 billion arms deal to Saudi Arabia that began in the Obama administration**. Further, there is no deal: just letters of interest for "intended sales," but no contracts. ([Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/))

12/ **Comey will stop short of accusing Trump of obstructing justice in his congressional testimony**, despite some legal experts saying Trump's requests could meet the legal definition of obstruction. Comey will also dispute Trump's assertion that Comey told him three times he is not under investigation. "He is not going to Congress to make accusations about the president’s intent, instead he’s there to share his concerns." ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-comey-stop-short-trump-obstructed-justice-flynn/story?id=47865739))

13/ **Trump might live-tweet during Comey's testimony on Thursday**.

14/ **Sean Spicer said Trump's tweets are official statements**, but didn't indicate whether that included both of his Twitter handles: @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. Regardless, the ACLU said they will use Trump's tweets to build their argument in the Supreme Court case on the travel ban. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/trump-tweets-official-statements/))
