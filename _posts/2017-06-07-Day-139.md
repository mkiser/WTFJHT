1/ **Two intelligence chiefs repeatedly refused to say whether Trump asked them to intervene in the Russia probe** during their public Senate intelligence committee testimony. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers declined to discuss the specifics of private conversations they had with Trump and whether they had been asked to push back against an FBI probe into collusion between the campaign and the Russian government. Both hinted that they would  share more information with senators privately.

3/ **Trump told Comey "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty"** at a private White House dinner in January, according to Comey's prepared remarks, which were released ahead of his Senate Intelligence Committee testimony tomorrow. Comey said he thought the encounter was designed to "create some part of patronage relationship." Later, in March, Trump pressured Comey to “lift the cloud” put over the administration from the ongoing investigation and repeatedly asked Comey to announce that he was not personally under investigation.

([Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/initial-comments-james-comeys-written-testimony))

4/ **Comey told Jeff Sessions he did not want to be left alone with Trump** after the president pressured him to end his investigation into Michael Flynn. Comey confronted Sessions after the encounter, believing that the Justice Department should protect the FBI from White House influence, which it typically does to avoid the appearance of political meddling in law enforcement. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/comey-sessions-trump.html))

5/ **Comey's role in the Russia probe has Trump "infuriated at a deep-gut, personal level,"** Newt Gingrich said. "He's not going to let some guy like that smear him without punching him as hard as he can."

6/ **Jeff Sessions offered to resign after a series of heated exchanges with Trump**.

8/ **Eric Trump says Democrats are "not even people"** in <s>an interview</s> tirade with Sean Hannity. "I’ve never seen hatred like this. To me, they’re not even people. It’s so, so sad. Morality’s just gone, morals have flown out the window, and we deserve so much better than this as a country. You see the Democratic Party, they’re imploding. They’re imploding. They became obstructionists because they have no message of their own," he said before added that the head of the Democratic National Committee a "total whack job."

10/ **Trump's pick for FBI director blindsided White House staff and Congress**, leaving much of his senior staff out of the loop before announcing he'd picked Christopher Wray on Twitter.

Wray acted as Chris Christie’s personal attorney during the Bridgegate scandal. Trump called him a "man of impeccable credentials."

12/ **Fox News host to Trump: "Fake news media" isn’t the issue. "It’s you."** Neil Cavuto hit Trump for his criticism of how the media has covered his Twitter habits, saying "Mr. President, it’s not the fake news media that’s your problem. It’s you. It’s not just your tweeting, it’s your scapegoating. It’s your refusal to see that sometimes you’re the one who’s feeding your own beast and acting beastly with your own guys. Look at the critiques you’re now hearing from usually friendly and supportive allies as sort of like an intervention. Because firing off these angry missives and tweets risks your political discussion."
