1/ **Trump breaks his Twitter silence, declaring "total and complete vindication"** in response to Comey's testimony. The tweet ends his second-longest Twitter drought – at about 2,753 minutes – since he declared his candidacy. Comey detailed months of distrust during testimony and asserted that Trump had fired him to interfere with the probe of Russia's ties to the campaign.

* **Behind Trump's temporary Twitter silence: Let others do the punching.** First it was Donald Trump Jr. who played his father's role on Twitter, then Trump's personal lawyer delivered the formal response.

* **Comey's indictment of Trump**. The fired FBI director's demeanor did little to mask his barbed accusations. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/james-comey-russia-trump-hearing-indictment-239310))

2/ **Trump's lawyer plans to file a complaint against Comey for leaking his memos**. Marc Kasowitz will file complaints with the Justice Department Inspector General and the Senate judiciary committee accusing Comey of violating executive privilege, which was called  "frivolous grandstanding" by an expert in whistleblower protection.

3/ **Jeff Sessions may have met with the Russian ambassador a third time**, Comey told senators in a closed hearing. The information is based in part on Russian-to-Russian intercepts talking about the meeting. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/politics/jeff-sessions-kislyak-meeting/))

4/ **Paul Ryan insisted that Republicans wouldn't call for impeachment of a Democratic president** accused of the same actions as Trump. Ryan also suggested that Trump's behavior might be the result of not having experience in government before becoming president.

5/ **Trump will spend the weekend at his golf club** in Bedminster, NJ. He's claimed in the past that working from "home" will save taxpayers money by not being at Trump Tower in New York City. ([NJ.com](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/trump_returning_to_nj_this_weekend.html))

6/ **Mitch McConnell took a procedural step to fast-track efforts to repeal Obamacare**, which side-steps typical committee processes. By invoking Rule 14, McConnell can now put the bill on the Senate calendar so that a vote can be held as soon as the bill is ready. The move means the Senate GOP can bypass committee hearings and debates of the Republican health care bill in an effort to get a vote by July 4.
