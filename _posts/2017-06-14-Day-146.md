1/ **Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice**, marking a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation. The obstruction of justice investigation into the president began days after Comey was fired on May 9 with the team actively pursuing potential witnesses inside and outside the government. The White House is referring all questions about the Russia investigation to Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.

2/ **Almost 200 congressional Democrats will sue Trump over foreign business ties**. They contend that Trump has ignored the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval. The case is one of at least four pending lawsuits alleging that by retaining interests in a global business empire, Trump has violated the foreign emoluments clause.

4/ **The majority of Trump's real estate sales are to secretive shell companies**, which obscure the buyers’ identities. Since winning the Republican nomination, about 70% of buyers of Trump properties were LLCs, compared with about 4% of buyers in the two years before. Since the election, Trump’s businesses have sold 28 properties for $33 million.

5/ **Trump gave the Pentagon authority to unilaterally send new troops to Afghanistan**. The Pentagon is weighing plans to send 3,000 to 5,000 troops after years of reductions in hopes that Kabul could handle threats on its own. There is fewer than 9,000 troops currently in Afghanistan.

6/ **Trump blocked a veterans group on Twitter that was critical of him**. While on the campaign trail, Trump praised veterans as "amazing," "distinguished" and "tremendous."

8/ **Tomorrow's congressional hearing to debate gun legislation has been canceled until further notice** in the wake of today's shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice. The panel was supposed to debate the "Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act," which would make it easier to purchase silencers, transport guns across state lines, and ease restrictions on armor-piercing bullets. The bill's sponsor was at the baseball practice. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/politics/gun-legislation-hearing-congressional-shooting/index.html))

9/ **Not a single state supports the House health care bill**.

10/ **The Senate approved new bipartisan sanctions against Russia**, which establishes a congressional review of any changes the Trump administration wants to make to the current penalties.

11/ **Robert Mueller met with the Senate intelligence committee to plot a path forward** on their investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
