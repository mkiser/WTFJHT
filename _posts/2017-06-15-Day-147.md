2/ **Aides blame Trump for the obstruction of justice probe: "The president did this to himself"** and "shot himself in the foot again with this cockamamie scheme to get Mueller to play ball" by spreading rumors that Trump might fire the special counsel. Senators, White House aides, former prosecutors, and FBI veterans are urging Trump not to do it, as firing Mueller now would require him to personally direct the Department of Justice to do so, which "could be shown that his purpose was to impede the investigation" and "could be additional evidence of obstruction of justice."

The administration is arguing that the court orders blocking the ban had implicitly delayed the effective date.

8/ **Despite being investigated by the FBI, Paul Manafort is still offering prospective business partners access to Trump**. Manafort consulted on a proposal for a Chinese construction billionaire. A lawyer involved in discussions said, “He’s going around telling people that he’s still talking to the president and — even more than that — that he is helping to shape Trump’s foreign policy." Trump’s former campaign chairman is at the center of the FBI investigation into ties between Trump’s team and the Russians.
