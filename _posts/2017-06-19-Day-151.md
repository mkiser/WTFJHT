Witch Hunt.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/us/politics/trump-lawyer-special-counsel-russia-not-under-investigation.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/1783b0ea8f2c4da898e214c735414eaf/Trump-attorney-says-president-not-under-investigation))

4/ **The White House is pushing the House Republicans for a friendlier sanctions deal against Russia**.

6/ **McConnell wants to force a health care vote by July 4th** and is considering making even deeper cuts to Medicaid spending than the bill passed by the House.

7/ **Democrats are turning to procedural moves to slow Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare** by objecting to all unanimous consent requests in the Senate. It likely won’t change the timing of the health care vote, but it will force Republicans to answer for what Democrats say is a rushed process and bad policy.

* **Six people have resigned from Trump's HIV/AIDS advisory council because he "doesn't care."** Trump has not appointed anyone to head the White House Office of National AIDS Policy.

9/ **The personal information and voter profile data on 198 million American voters was stored on an unsecured server** owned by Republican data analytics firm Deep Root Analytics. The folder includes dozens of spreadsheets containing a unique identifier for each voter for the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, which link to "dozens of sensitive and personally identifying data points, making it possible to piece together a striking amount of detail on individual Americans specified by name."
