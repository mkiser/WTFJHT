1/ **Sean Spicer is searching for his own replacement** as he's expected to transition to a behind-the-scenes role overseeing communications strategy – senior to both the communications director and press secretary. Spicer's deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has frequently replaced him in the daily press briefings as he's slowly retreated from public view over the past month. He's often caught between striving for the respect of the press corps and Trump's erratic tweets. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/19/sean-spicer-replacement-press-secretary-239721) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-19/trump-said-to-weigh-new-role-for-press-secretary-sean-spicer) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/spicer-may-leave-the-press-room-podium-behind-for-a-more-backstage-white-house-role/2017/06/19/d7eb94e8-553a-11e7-b38e-35fd8e0c288f_story.html))

2/ **Steve Bannon explains the change in Spicer's role: "Sean got fatter."** The White House has pared back the daily press briefings, downgrading them from "briefings" to "gaggles," and from on-camera to off-camera. They are now shorter and less frequent. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/where-have-all-the-cameras-gone/530916/))

3/ **Spicer hasn't talked to Trump about whether Russia interfered in the election**. The US intelligence community concluded that Russia orchestrated a hacking and influence campaign to swing the election in Trump's favor. "I have not sat down and asked him about the specific reaction," Spicer said. "I'd be glad to touch base with him and get back to you." Trump's repeatedly raised doubts about their conclusions.

4/ **The Senate will vote on their health care bill next week**, despite not having enough support to pass it.

The Senate could hold a vote next Thursday, before lawmakers leave for the July 4th recess. Failure to vote by then would open Republican lawmakers up to pressure from constituents at town-hall meetings.

7/ **Michael Flynn failed to report a business trip to Saudi Arabia** where he represented US and Russian state-sponsored companies, and Saudi financing interests to build 16 nuclear power plants a congressional letter issued Monday shows. The letter questions why Flynn failed to mention one trip and underreported a second for the renewal of his federal security clearance.
