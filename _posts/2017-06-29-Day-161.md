1/ **Trump assailed television host Mika Brzezinski on Twitter for "bleeding badly from a face-lift."** Trump targeted both Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough in a pair of morning tweets, referring to Brzezinski as "low I.Q. Crazy Mika" and Scarborough as "Psycho Joe." He then opined on the physical appearance of Brzezinski, saying he declined meeting with the pair at Mar-a-Lago during the winter because "she was bleeding badly from a face-lift." Brzezinski responded in a tweet of her own, mocking Trump's "little hands." Brzezinski and her fiancé Scarborough are co-hosts of the MSNBC show "Morning Joe." About two hours before his tweets, Brzezinski said on the show that "it's not normal behavior" for any leader to tweet about a person's appearances, bully, lie, undermine managers, or throw people under the bus.
