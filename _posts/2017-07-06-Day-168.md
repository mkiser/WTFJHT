1/ **Trump downplayed Russian election meddling, saying it "could be Russia" but "nobody really knows for sure."** He added that it "could’ve been other people and other countries," casting doubt on the conclusion of 17 US intelligence agencies and likening it to the incorrect assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He blamed Obama for not doing anything to stop the meddling.

Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/europe/donald-trump-poland-speech.html))
