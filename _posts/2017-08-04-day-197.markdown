1/ **Robert Mueller's grand jury has issued subpoenas related to Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer**. The subpoenas, issued in recent weeks, seek documents and testimony from people involved in the meeting. Yesterday, it was reported that [Mueller had convened a grand jury investigation in Washington](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/03/day-196/#1-special-counsel-robert-mueller-has) to examine allegations of Russian interference in the election. When Mueller took over the investigation in May, he inherited a grand jury in Alexandria, VA, which was impaneled to assist in the Michael Flynn investigation and focus on Flynn's work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests.

2/ **Trump used a campaign-style rally to attack the Russia investigation**, hours after news broke that special counsel Robert Mueller had tapped a grand jury. He referred to the investigation as a "totally made-up Russia story" and a "total fabrication." He insisted that Democrats "can't beat us at the voting booths, so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us, and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution."

3/ **Kellyanne Conway tried to downplay the ongoing investigation**, saying: "Let me remind everyone what the president has said about this. It's a witch-hunt. It's fake. Last night I believe \[Trump\] called it a fabrication. And we know that the nature of these types of investigations become fishing expeditions, where you're just throwing jello up against the wall and hoping it will stick."

4/ **The FBI monitored social media on Election Day to track a suspected Russian disinformation campaign spreading "fake news"** and identify possible disruptions to the vote. For the FBI, monitoring the news put them "right on the edge of Constitutional legality" given the First Amendment's free speech protections. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/politics/election-day-cyber-threat-fbi-monitoring/index.html))

5/ **The Senate unanimously blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments** during the August break. The Senate will hold nine "pro-forma" sessions — brief meetings that normally last roughly a minute – and will not hold any legislative sessions until lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/senate-blocks-trump-from-making-recess-appointments-2468906507.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/345261-senate-blocks-trump-from-making-recess-appointments-over-break))

* **The Senate breaks for summer recess**. There will be no more roll-call votes in the Senate until September 5th.

6/ **The Secret Service has vacated Trump Tower** after a dispute between the government and Trump's company over the terms of its lease. In March, the [Secret Service requested $26.8 million](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/03/22/Day-62/#11-the-secret-service-has-asked-for) to protect Trump Tower. Separately, [the government is paying $130,000 a month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/19/day-181/#10-the-military-is-paying-130-000-a) to lease space in Trump Tower for a military office that supports the White House. Trump has not visited Trump Tower since he was inaugurated.

7/ **Jeff Sessions issued a warning that the "culture of leaking must stop"** a day after [transcripts leaked](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/03/day-196/#7-trump-urged-the-mexican-president) of Trump's January phone calls with Mexico and Australia. Sessions vowed to bring criminal charges against people who had leaked classified information, while announcing that the FBI had created a new counterintelligence unit to manage these cases. The Justice Department is pursuing three times as many leak investigations as the Obama administration. Sessions wants to pursue "effective" subpoenas on media outlets, because "simply put, these leaks hurt our country." Kellyanne Conway suggested using lie detectors to figure who's leaking information. "It's easier to figure out who's leaking than the leakers may realize," she said.

* **Diplomats laughing at Trump over leaked Mexico transcript**, saying "he's the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt. He speaks loudly and carries a small stick." ([McClatchy DC](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article165303667.html))

8/ **John Kelly has brought rigor to the White House**, attempting to give Trump bureaucratic competence while forcing staff members to stay in their lanes. He's attempting to broker peace between the different factions in the West Wing, telling employees that he was hired to manage the staff, not the president. Kelly encouraged National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to make any staffing changes necessary, which resulted in the firing of a top intelligence aide Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was hired by Michael Flynn, after months of trying. Kelly has also assured Jeff Sessions that his job is safe.

9/ **The Trump administration will notify the United Nations today that the US intends to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement**, despite planning to participate in UN climate negotiations later this year. Under the terms of the Paris deal, the US can't fully withdraw until one day after the next presidential election. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/climate/us-to-join-climate-talks-despite-planned-withdrawal-from-paris-accord.html) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/04/trump-notice-withdraw-from-paris-climate-deal-241331))

10/ **A Republican donor is suing the GOP for fraud over the failed Obamacare repeal**. The lawsuit alleges that the GOP raised millions of dollars in campaign funds knowing they weren't going to be able to overturn the ACA, representing "a pattern of Racketeering which involves massive fraud perpetrated on Republican voters and contributors as well as some Independents and Democrats."
