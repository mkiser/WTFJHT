1/ **The White House issued a statement condemning “white supremacists” for the violence that led to one death in Charlottesville more than 36 hours after the protests began**. It was meant to clarify Trump's earlier remarks and condemn “all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred” and “of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.” The statement came in an email sent to reporters and attributed to an unnamed representative. Trump had previously said: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."

* **Trump Is Criticized for Not Calling Out White Supremacists.** He was the only national political figure to spread blame for the “hatred, bigotry and violence” that resulted in the death of one person to “many sides.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/us/trump-charlottesville-protest-nationalist-riot.html))

2/ **The White House’s clarification stopped short of what Republicans have urged Trump to do: directly call out and condemn white supremacy**. Three of Trump's top advisers attempted to defend his vague statements: Ivanka Trump tweeted that “There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis.” National security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump was “very clear” in his statement and “called out anyone, anyone who is responsible for fomenting this kind of bigotry, hatred, racism and violence.” And, CIA Director Mike Pompeo said Trump was “specific,” “very clear” and, “frankly, pretty unambiguous” in responding to the violence, adding “When someone marches with a Nazi flag, that's unacceptable, and I think that's what the president said yesterday.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/13/white-house-doubles-down-on-trumps-charlottesville-comments-ignores-calls-to-directly-confront-white-supremacy/))

3/ **Pence spoke out more forcefully than Trump on Charlottesville**, saying: “We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-confronts-backlash-over-trumps-remarks-on-charlottesville/2017/08/13/de027622-8036-11e7-ab27-1a21a8e006ab_story.html))

TK/ **Contrasting Trump's reluctance to criticize white supremacists, Jeff Sessions said the “evil attack” in Charlottesville is an act of domestic terrorism**. “You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation toward the most serious charges that can be brought because this is unequivocally an unacceptable evil attack." McMaster added: "Certainly I think we can confidently call it a form of terrorism."

4/ **Even Anthony Scaramucci criticized Trump's unwillingness to single out white supremacy groups**. “I wouldn’t have recommended that statement," the former White House communications director said. "I think he needed to be much harsher as it related to the white supremacists and the nature of that."
