1/ **Trump retweeted an alt-right conspiracy theorist, a train hitting CNN, and a critic calling him a fascist**.  Last night, Trump retweeted Jack Posobiec, an alt-right figure who pushed the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. Then this morning, Trump retweeted an image of a person holding a CNN sign being hit by a train, with the commentary, "Nothing can stop the #TrumpTrain!!" The White House said the tweet was inadvertently posted and it was deleted. And, finally, Trump retweeted a critic who called Trump a "fascist" for "seriously considering" pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was found guilty of ignoring a judge's order to stop racially profiling Latinos during patrols.

2/ **Three CEOs resign from Trump's advisory council over his slow denouncement of white supremacists**. The chief executives of Merck, Under Armour, and Intel all quit the manufacturing council.

4/ **The leaders of four minority House caucus groups sent a letter to Trump asking him to fire Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Sebastian Gorka**. “Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence US policy,” the heads of the black, Hispanic, Asian and progressive caucuses wrote, suggesting that their continued presence in the White House is emboldening a resurgence of white supremacy.
