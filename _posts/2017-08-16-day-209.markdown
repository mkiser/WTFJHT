1/ **Trump's staff is "stunned and disheartened" by his Charlottesville remarks**. They say they "never expected to hear such a voluble articulation of opinions that the president had long expressed in private." [YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY GIVE SOURCES FOR YOUR 2 QUOTATIONS. OTHERWISE THERE IS NO CREDIBILITY HERE]  While Trump has repeatedly said he is not prejudiced, his statements against white nationalists and racist organizations have been equivocal: It started on Saturday with his comment placing blame [“on many sides,"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/14/day-207/#1-the-white-house-issued-a-statement) which was followed by a stronger denunciation of hate groups via email, attributed to an unnamed “spokesperson.” On Monday, Trump said that [“racism is evil,"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/14/day-207/#5-trump-finally-denounced-white-supr) but by Tuesday, Trump had [reassigned “blame on both sides”](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/15/day-208/#2-trump-again-blamed-both-sides-for) for the Charlottesville violence, singling out "alt-left" groups who were “very, very violent."

2/ **Obama’s response to the Charlottesville violence is now the most liked tweet in Twitter’s history**. The former president quoted Nelson Mandela, saying: “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion … People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love … For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite." Trump, meanwhile, [placed "blame on both sides.](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/15/day-208/#2-trump-again-blamed-both-sides-for) And I have no doubt about it."

There can be no moral ambiguity.” ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/paul-ryan-condemns-white-supremacy-after-trump-press-conference) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/346701-ryan-white-supremacy-is-repulsive))
