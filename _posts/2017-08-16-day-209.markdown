1/ **Trump's staff is "stunned and disheartened" by his Charlottesville remarks**. They say they "never expected to hear such a voluble articulation of opinions that the president had long expressed in private." While Trump has repeatedly said he is not prejudiced, his statements against white nationalists and racist organizations have been equivocal: It started on Saturday with his comment placing blame [“on many sides,"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/14/day-207/#1-the-white-house-issued-a-statement) which was followed by a stronger denunciation of hate groups via email, attributed to an unnamed “spokesperson.” On Monday, Trump said that [“racism is evil,"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/14/day-207/#5-trump-finally-denounced-white-supr) but by Tuesday, Trump had [reassigned “blame on both sides”](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/15/day-208/#2-trump-again-blamed-both-sides-for) for the Charlottesville violence, singling out "alt-left" groups who were “very, very violent."

2/ **Obama’s response to the Charlottesville violence is now the most liked tweet in Twitter’s history**. The former president quoted Nelson Mandela, saying: “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion … People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love … For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite." Trump, meanwhile, [placed "blame on both sides.](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/15/day-208/#2-trump-again-blamed-both-sides-for) And I have no doubt about it."

5/ **Paul Ryan called white supremacy “repulsive”** in a tweet hours after Trump doubled down on his claim that "many sides" are to blame for the violence in Charlottesville. “We must be clear," Ryan tweeted.

There can be no moral ambiguity.” ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/paul-ryan-condemns-white-supremacy-after-trump-press-conference) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/346701-ryan-white-supremacy-is-repulsive))
