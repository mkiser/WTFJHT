2/ **White House aides are wrestling with how to respond to Trump after he doubled down that “both sides” were to blame in Charlottesville**. Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, who is Jewish, was “disgusted” and “frantically unhappy" by Trump's remarks that there were some “very fine people" at the white nationalist rally. John Kelly, the new chief of staff, has been trying to instill a sense of discipline in the West Wing, but is "frustrated and dismayed" by Trump's self-inflicted controversies, from his North Korea rhetoric to publicly attacking Mitch McConnell.

4/ **Steve Bannon intentionally gave an [outrageous interview](http://prospect.org/article/steve-bannon-unrepentant) then pretended he didn't know he was giving it in order to divert attention from Charlottesville**.
