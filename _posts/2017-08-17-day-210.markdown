2/ **White House aides are wrestling with how to respond to Trump after he doubled down that “both sides” were to blame in Charlottesville**. Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, who is Jewish, was “disgusted” and “frantically unhappy" by Trump's remarks that there were some “very fine people" at the white nationalist rally. John Kelly, the new chief of staff, has been trying to instill a sense of discipline in the West Wing, but is "frustrated and dismayed" by Trump's self-inflicted controversies, from his North Korea rhetoric to publicly attacking Mitch McConnell.

3/ **Jeff Sessions criticized Chicago’s “sanctuary city” policy**, saying the "respect for the rule of law has broken down." He tied the violence in Chicago to its refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, arguing that it's made Chicago a haven for predators and drug dealers.

5/ **Trump’s personal lawyer forwarded an email warning that Black Lives Matter “has been totally infiltrated by terrorist groups"** and that Robert E.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/us/politics/trump-lawyer-email-race-charlottesville.html) / [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/john-dowd-donald-trump-lawyer-robert-e-lee/index.html))

6/ **Trump spread a debunked rumor while responding to the Barcelona terror attack on Twitter** less than an hour after issuing an initial, measured statement.

Pershing who allegedly dipped bullets in pigs' blood to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines whose religion forbid contact with the animals.
