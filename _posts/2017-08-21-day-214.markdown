1/ **The Secret Service has blown through its budget to pay agents because of Trump's frequent travel and large family**. More than 1,000 agents have hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year. The Secret Service has enough to money to continue protecting Trump and his family through September. If Congress don’t lift the cap, about a third of the agency’s agents would be working overtime without being paid.

However, Akhmetshin's ties to the Russian government and Kremlin-backed oligarchs are much deeper than was previously known.
