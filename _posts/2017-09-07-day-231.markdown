1/ **Trump Jr. met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to determine Hillary Clinton's "fitness, character or qualifications" for office**, according to a prepared statement delivered to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators. He maintains that nothing came of the meeting, and he denies explicit collusion with Russia. Trump Jr. took questions behind closed doors.

2/ **Nancy Pelosi urged Trump to reassure DACA recipients they would not be deported within the next six months, and he acquiesced**. The message runs counter to previous White House talking points, which [suggest](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/09/05/daca.talking.points%5B8%5D.pdf) DREAMers should "prepare for" imminent departure from the country. Pelosi later [said](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/349634-pelosi-trump-says-that-he-would-sign-the-dream-act-if-it-passed) that if Congress passes the DREAM Act, Trump "would sign it."

3/ **Under Betsy DeVos, the Department of Education will replace an Obama-era guidance on campus sexual assault**. In a speech, DeVos argued the move is "not about letting institutions off the hook," but rather about balancing the rights of victims and the accused. The Obama guidance said universities were compelled to combat sexual harassment and violence under Title IX.

4/ **The United States is urging the U.N. Security Council to impose a North Korean oil embargo and ban exports of the country's textiles**.

5/ **In a meeting with Congressional leaders, Trump suggested the debt ceiling should be scrapped altogether**.
