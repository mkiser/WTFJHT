2/ **The Trump administration has asked Supreme Court justices to continue to allow strict enforcement of its temporary refugee ban**.

3/ **The FBI is investigating whether Russian news agency Sputnik has violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act**. The law bars organizations from acting as undeclared governmental propaganda arms. The FBI has obtained several thousand internal Sputnik documents and emails and has interviewed a former White House correspondent who was fired in May.

5/ **Infrastructure for Trump's latest golf club, in Dubai, will be partially built by a Chinese firm**, despite Trump's promise not to work with foreign entities as president.
