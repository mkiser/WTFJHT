1/ **Top Democrats announced they had struck a deal with Trump to save DREAMers from deportation**. After a White House dinner, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi reported they would pursue a legislative option for DACA that included provisions for border security—excluding building a wall. In response to criticism from right-wing media and his base, Trump tweeted that "no deal" had been struck and that the wall "will continue to be built."

3/ **In a policy reversal, the Office of Government Ethics will now allow anonymous donations to White House legal defense funds**.

4/ **Tim Scott, the sole black Republican in the Senate, sat down with Trump to rebut the president's claim that "both sides" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville**. Scott said he shared his thoughts on "the affirmation of hate groups" and "the last three centuries of challenges from white supremacists, white nationalists, KKK, Nazis." The White House described the meeting as indicative of Trump's commitment to "positive race relations."

5/ **National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster wrote a memo outlining a new anti-leak program that encompasses unclassified information**.
