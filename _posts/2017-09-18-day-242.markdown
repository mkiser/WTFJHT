1/ **Overheard in a Washington steakhouse, a White House counsel discussed the extent to which the administration should cooperate with the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a>**. Ty Cobb supports prompt turnover of all relevant emails and documents to special counsel Robert Mueller; Trump lawyer Don McGahn is concerned doing so might weaken the White House's future position.

2/ **Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly, calling it out for "mismanagement" and claiming it had not reached "its full potential."** In his opening remarks, he also praised Trump World Tower, a "successful project" located "right across the street" from the United Nations. Trump's rhetoric toward North Korea [escalated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-warns-that-time-is-running-out-for-peaceful-solution-with-north-korea/2017/09/17/101dcdea-9bd6-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.ffaec16b211d) over the weekend.

3/ **Republican senators are pushing for a last-minute vote on the latest bill to repeal the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>**. Led by Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, the effort to pass the bill in question has not currently garnered enough votes. John McCain continues to advocate for putting the bill through committee.

In a public statement, Flynn's siblings emphasized that the legal fees required of former Trump aides "far exceed their ability to pay."

5/ **The Trump administration confirmed it is indeed pulling out of the Paris Agreement** despite reports to the contrary. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-wont-withdraw-from-paris-climate-deal-1505593922) that top officials were considering remaining a party to the agreement. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster called the article "a false report." The United States cannot formally withdraw from the deal until 2020.
