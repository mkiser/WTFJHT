1/ **Trump's top economic adviser "can't guarantee" taxes won't go up for the middle class**. Gary Cohn said Trump's tax plan is "purely aimed at middle-class families," but "it depends which state you live in." He added that the rich will not benefit under the plan. Trump wanted to propose a 15% corporate rate rather than the 20% announced, which is down from the current 35%.

2/ **Trump waived the shipping restrictions for Puerto Rico**, which were limiting access to food, medicine, clothing, and supplies for hurricane relief. The move comes after criticism that the White House had been slow to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria. The waiver will be in effect for 10 days and will cover all products being shipped to the island. Meanwhile, the administration is reportedly forcing evacuees from Puerto Rico and Dominica to sign promissory notes to pay for transportation costs and is keeping evacuees' passports as collateral.

3/ **The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify on Russian meddling** at a public hearing on November 1st. The committee wants to know if fake news spread by Russians accounts on Twitter made it into real news stories and what steps the company took to stop it. The House Intelligence Committee also wants to hold an open hearing next month with representatives from several unnamed technology companies in an effort to “better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.” A new [Oxford University study](http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/2017/09/28/social-media-news-and-political-information-during-the-us-election-was-polarizing-content-concentrated-in-swing-states/) shows there was a higher concentration of misinformation, polarizing political and conspiratorial news shared on Twitter from Russian, WikiLeaks, and junk news sources in the swing states Trump won than in uncontested states.

4/ **A Russian-backed group impersonated a real American Muslim organization on Facebook and Instagram to spread misinformation**. The United Muslims of America pushed memes that claimed Hillary Clinton admitted the US “created, funded and armed” al-Qaeda and ISIS, claimed that John McCain was ISIS’ true founder, and alleged Osama bin Laden was a “CIA agent.” ([The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russians-impersonated-real-american-muslims-to-stir-chaos-on-facebook-and-instagram))
