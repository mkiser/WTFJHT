1/ **Trump told his highest-ranking military leaders he wanted a tenfold increase in the US nuclear arsenal** during a July 20th meeting at the Pentagon. Shortly after the meeting ended, Rex Tillerson called Trump a ["fucking moron"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/04/day-258/#1-rex-tillerson-reportedly-called-tr) to the officials who remained behind. Any increase in the nuclear arsenal would break with decades of US nuclear doctrine and violate international disarmament treaties signed by every president since Ronald Reagan.

2/ **In response to the NBC News story, Trump tweeted that NBC’s broadcast license should be pulled as punishment** for reporting what he considers fake news. “Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!” Trump tweeted. “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/11/trump-nbc-broadcast-license-243667) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/354888-trump-fake-nbc-news-nuke-story-pure-fiction))

* **One of Trump’s oldest friends says the president is "better than this."** Thomas Barrack Jr. said he has been “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump's rhetoric and tweets, and wonders why his longtime friend spends so much of his time appealing to the fringes of American politics. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-better-than-this-says-thomas-barrack-trumps-loyal-whisperer/2017/10/10/067fc776-a215-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html))

3/ **Homeland Security is exploring how it could transform the immigration system without Congress**. The possible changes could limit protections for unaccompanied minors who come to the US illegally, expand the use of quick deportation proceedings, and tighten visa programs that could limit legal immigration to the US. None of the policies have been finalized. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/politics/trump-administration-dhs-immigration-policies/index.html))

4/ **The Supreme Court dismissed one of the challenges to Trump’s now-expired travel ban**. The justices were not ruling on the merits of the issue, but said that because the executive order “expired by its own terms” on September 24th, "the appeal no longer presents a 'live case or controversy.'"

5/ **Cambridge Analytica’s work for Trump’s campaign is now as part of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a>**.

6/ **North Korea hackers may have stolen joint US-South Korean military secrets**, including a "decapitation strike" targeting Kim Jong Un and other leaders.

7/ **Republicans and close advisers are describing Trump as “unstable,” “losing a step,” and “unraveling.”** There’s a new level of concern that the White House is in crisis as advisers struggle to contain him. Trump reportedly vented to his security chief: “I hate everyone in the White House! There are a few exceptions, but I hate them!” Meanwhile, John Kelly has tightened the flow of information and visitors, which has frustrated Trump and resulted in “shouting matches” between the two men.
