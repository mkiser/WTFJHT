1/ **Trump denied telling the widow of a fallen soldier "he knew what he signed up for,"** contradicting a Florida congresswoman who was with the woman at the time. "Basically, he said, 'Well, I guess he knew what he signed up for," Congresswoman Frederica Wilson said, recounting the conversation she heard on speakerphone. "But I guess it still hurt.' That's what he said." 

Trump tweeted that the "Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof)," raising questions about whether Trump tapes calls and conversations. Sarah Sanders said there is no recording of the call, adding that Wilson's conduct is "appalling and disgusting." The mother of the fallen soldier stood behind Wilson's account, saying that Trump "did disrespect" the family with his comments during the call.

2/ **The White House had drafted a statement of sympathy following the ambush in Niger** where [four Green Berets were killed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/17/day-271/#3-trump-falsely-claimed-that-obama-d). Trump never issued the statement, which was circulated to the National Security Council  and Defense Department. On Monday, Trump was asked why he had not spoken publicly about the deaths. He defended himself by saying he'd written letters, and then lied that Obama and other past presidents had never or rarely called the families of troops who died.

3/ **Trump offered a grieving military father $25,000** and said he would establish an online fundraiser for the family. Neither happened. The father said the White House sent a condolence letter from Trump instead. "I opened it up and read it, and I was hoping to see a check in there, to be honest," the father said. A White House spokesperson said "the check has been sent," adding that "It’s disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the President, and using it to advance the media’s biased agenda."

4/ **Trump backed off his support for the bipartisan healthcare deal**, tweeting he could never support legislation "bailing out" insurance companies "who have made a fortune" from Obamacare. The comment comes a day after Trump [embraced the deal](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/17/day-271/#5-senators-have-agreed-in-principle) as "a short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period." The chairman of the Senate health committee said Trump "completely engineered the plan" to fund subsidies for health insurers, but "wants to reserve his options."

6/ **A second federal judge blocked Trump's latest travel ban attempt** citing Trump's tweets as evidence the policy carries the same intent as his Muslim ban proposal. The Maryland judge granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the latest iteration of the travel ban, following a [similar order](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/17/day-271/#10-a-federal-judge-in-hawaii-has-blo) by a federal judge in Hawaii. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang said the administration had "not shown that national security cannot be maintained without an unprecedented eight-country travel ban."

7/ **Trump tweeted that James Comey had prematurely exonerated Hillary Clinton "long before \[the\] investigation was complete"** into her private email use.

9/ **Democrats asked the chairman of the House oversight committee to subpoena the White House for documents related to Michael Flynn** and his company the Flynn Intel Group. "\[T\]he White House has been openly defying this Committee’s bipartisan request for documents regarding General Flynn for months without any assertion of privilege of any kind," 18 Democrats wrote in a 10-page letter to Trey Gowdy. "We believe that this paper trail must be pursued to answer the gravest questions of all — did General Flynn seek to change the course of our country’s national security to benefit the private interests he previously promoted?" A Gowdy aide said he was reviewing whether the White House’s limited response to previously inquiries was sufficient.

12/ **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to allow an undocumented teenager to get an abortion**. The pregnant teenager, who was apprehended crossing the border from Mexico illegally last month, was being held in a federally funded shelter in South Texas where Trump administration officials had prevented the shelter from allowing her to travel to an abortion provider. The judge said she was “astounded” at the government’s position that the teen’s only options were to either carry the unwanted pregnancy to term or go back to her home country.

poll/ **52% of Americans oppose Trump's recent tax reform proposal** while 34% say they support the plan. The tax plan would consolidate the number of tax rates from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 35%.
