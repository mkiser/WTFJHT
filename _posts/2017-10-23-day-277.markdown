1/ **Betsy DeVos rescinded 72 guidelines that protect the rights of disabled students** under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The Department of Education called the policies "outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective." During her [confirmation hearing](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/07/Day-19/#2-betsy-devos-is-confirmed-as-educat) in January, DeVos said she was "confused" about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act when asked whether she supported it. DeVos said she thought it was best "left to the states," but "is certainly worth discussion."
