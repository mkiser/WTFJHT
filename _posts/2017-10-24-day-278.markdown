1/ **Two House panels opened a joint investigation into the Justice Department's actions during the 2016 campaign**.

3/ **The firm behind the "Trump dossier" asked a judge to block the House Intelligence Committee from obtaining its bank records**. Fusion GPS argues that the [committee's subpoena](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/16/day-270/#10-the-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier) threatens the First Amendment rights of the journalists who compiled the dossier by requiring them to reveal the identities of clients who sought political research from the firm, and poses an "existential threat" to the company.

4/ **A small Montana utility company linked to the Trump administration won a $300 million contract to repair Puerto Rico's electrical infrastructure**. The private-equity firm that finances Whitefish Energy, HBC Investments, was founded by Joe Colonnetta, who contributed $20,000 to the Trump Victory PAC during the general election, $2,700 to Trump’s primary election campaign, $2,700 to Trump’s general election campaign, and a total of $30,700 to the Republican National Committee in 2016 alone. Whitefish Energy is also located in the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who is friends with the Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski.

 5/ **The Trump administration will allow admission to refugees from all countries**, but with new rules to better vet applicants. Refugee admissions had been [halted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/12/day-236/#2-a-supreme-court-justice-temporaril) in June for 120 days as part of Trump's travel ban. The administration will now collect more personal data, such as names of family members and places of employment, as well as mine social media posts to see.

6/ **Rematch: The feud between Trump and Bob Corker was relit ahead of the president's critical meeting with Senate Republicans on taxes** after Corker appeared on both NBC's "Today" show and ABC's "Good Morning America." He said Trump should "step aside" from tax reform, stop "kneecap\[ping\] your secretary of state," and "leave it to the professionals for a while and see if we can do something that's constructive for our country."

Trump tweeted that Corker was trying to stymie his agenda, called him a "lightweight," and charged that Corker "couldn't get  elected dog catcher in Tennessee" – whatever that means. Corker replied on Twitter: "Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff."

Then, in an [interview with CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/politics/corker-trump-photo-op-tax-plan/index.html), Corker escalated his criticism, calling Trump a serial liar, saying he regretted supporting him for president, accused him of debasing the country, and refused to say whether he trusted Trump with the nuclear codes. In an [interview with ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-sen-bob-corker-trump-leave-professionals/story?id=50675996), Corker stopped short of calling Trump a liar. Instead, he characterized Trump as "utterly untruthful."

* **Paul Ryan: people should ignore the "Twitter this and Twitter that"** and focus on the legislative actions taken by Congress. "So all this stuff you see on a daily basis on Twitter this and Twitter that, forget about it," Ryan said. "Let's focus on helping people, improving people's lives, and doing what we said we would do that accomplishes that. That's what we're focused on."

7/ **Trump has personally attacked 1 in 5 Republican senators**: Bob Corker, Ted Cruz, Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, Dean Heller, John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ben Sasse have all drawn Trump's ire. Republicans hold a 52-50 advantage in the Senate and can only afford to lose two votes on any piece of legislation.
