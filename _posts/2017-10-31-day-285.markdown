1/ **Trump spent yesterday "seething" as he watched the Mueller probe unfold on TV**. The [indictments](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/30/day-284/#1-in-a-12-count-indictment-robert-mu) of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates weren't a surprise to Trump, but the [guilty plea](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/30/day-284/#2-trumps-former-foreign-policy-advis) by George Papadopoulos for making false statements to the FBI was not expected. "The walls are closing in," said a senior Republican in close contact with top Trump staffers. "Everyone is freaking out."

2/ **Team Trump dismissed Papadopoulos as a "liar," their "coffee boy," and just a "young, low level volunteer"** after the former foreign policy adviser cut a [plea deal](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/30/day-284/#2-trumps-former-foreign-policy-advis) with prosecutors yesterday. In a morning tweet, Trump cast the Manafort charges as a sort of vindication for the campaign, but belittled Papadopoulos as proven liar, despite having called him "[an excellent guy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/03/21/a-transcript-of-donald-trumps-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/?utm_term=.9dd93142fe79&tid=a_inl)" in March 2016. On CNN's "New Day," Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide, reduced Papadopoulos to a "coffee boy" that "never did anything" for the campaign.

3/ **Court documents show that Papadopoulos shared his Russian outreach with several senior Trump campaign officials**. Here's the breakdown:

"The Campaign Supervisor" named in the documents is Sam Clovis, who served as Trump's national campaign co-chairman. Clovis urged Papadopoulos to organize an "off the record" meeting with Russian officials.

"High-Ranking Campaign Official" named is campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Papadopoulos wrote to Lewandowski several times to let him know that the Russians were interested in forging a relationship with the campaign, including an email about discussing "Russia’s interest in hosting Mr. Trump."

"Another high-ranking campaign official" is Paul Manafort, to whom Papadopoulos sent an email with the subject line "Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump." Manafort forwarded the email to another campaign official, stating: "We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips," referring to a trip to Russia. "It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."

* **Carter Page admitted that Russia "may have come up" in his Trump campaign emails, but "nothing major" was discussed**. Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser is scheduled to testify behind closed doors before a House intelligence committee panel on Thursday.

4/ **Steve Bannon advised Trump to find new lawyers**, because he believes that Ty Cobb and John Dowd, the top two attorneys on Trump's legal team, "are asleep at the wheel." Bannon is also pushing Trump to take action against Robert Mueller, urging him to defund the investigation – a move that would curtail Mueller without having to formally fire him.

5/ **Facebook, Twitter, and Google will appear before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee today**. Facebook will tell members that Russians bought 3,000 Facebook ads, which reached the newsfeeds of 126 million users – equivalent to more than half of the total U.S. voting population. Google found 1,108 videos with 43 hours of content related to the Russian effort on YouTube. And, Twitter identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 bots that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election.
