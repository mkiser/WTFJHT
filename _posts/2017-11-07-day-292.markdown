1/ **Carter Page testified that he received permission from Corey Lewandowski to visit Moscow** in July 2016, he told the House intelligence committee during a seven hour testimony yesterday. Page also told senior campaign officials Sam Clovis, Hope Hicks, and JD Gordon, as well as then-Senator Jeff Sessions about his trip to Russia. When he returned, Page sent an email to campaign officials saying he had received "incredible insights and outreach" from "senior members" of Putin’s administration and suggested that Trump should make a foreign policy speech in Russia and "raise the temperature a little bit." Page maintains that his trip was made was as a private citizen and unrelated to his role with the Trump campaign.

2/ **Trump told Mike Pompeo to meet with a former intelligence officer who claimed the DNC emails were "leaked" – not hacked**. The CIA director met with William Binney last month, who has challenged a January 2017 intelligence community report from CIA, the FBI, and the NSA that concludes "Putin ordered an influence campaign... to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency." Trump has called the report "fake news." ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2017/11/07/dnc-hack-trump-cia-director-william-binney-nsa/))

3/ **The White House has prepared an executive order to weaken the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate** that requires taxpayers demonstrate proof of insurance or pay a fine. The order would broaden the "hardship exemption" that was established for those who facing extraordinary circumstances (i.e. the death of a family member, bankruptcy, a natural disaster). Trump would sign the order if Republicans fail to include it in the tax reform process.
