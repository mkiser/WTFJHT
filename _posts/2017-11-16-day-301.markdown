1/ **House Republicans passed their tax bill**, which would cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years in a rewrite of the tax code. The bill also cuts the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, collapses the number of tax brackets from seven to four, and eliminates or scales back many popular deductions of individuals, including the state and local tax deduction, medical expenses deduction, and student loan deductions but would double the standard deduction. The bill passed with 227 votes in favor and 205 against.

2/ **The Senate tax bill would raise taxes on the middle class while giving large cuts to millionaires** over the next decade, according to [analysis](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?id=5040) by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Taxpayers would see their taxes cut by 7.4% on average in 2019, but by 2027 their taxes would rise by an average of 0.2%. Those making between $20,000 and $30,000 would have their tax bills rise 25.4% by 2027 while people earning over $100,000 continue to receive tax cuts.

3/ **A radio newscaster accused Al Franken of kissing and groping her without consent** during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office. Franken apologized to Leeann Tweeden, saying he doesn't remember the events of a kiss rehearsal "the same way" as she described. Franken added that a photo of him with his hands over a sleeping Tweeden's breasts "was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it."

* **Mitch McConnell immediately called for an Ethics Committee investigation of Al Franken** after allegations that he groped a woman in 2006. "As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter. I hope the Democratic Leader will join me on this," McConnell said. "Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable—in the workplace or anywhere else."

4/ **The Alabama Republican Party is sticking with Roy Moore despite at least nine women accusing him of inappropriate, unwanted sexual behavior**. Mitch McConnell has called Moore unfit to serve in the Senate and has [threatened](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/11/15/day-300/#5-mitch-mcconnell-proposed-that-jeff) him with an ethics investigation if he is elected in the December 12th special election.

5/ **Senate Republicans are exploring the legal feasibility of a second new special election in Alabama** in order to save the Republican seat. The plan would call for Luther Strange – who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions' vacant seat – to resign, causing a new special election in Alabama. Recent polling has the Democrat Doug Jones leading Moore by at least 12 points in the race. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/roy-moore-republicans-alabama-senate-244961))

Kushner received emails in September 2016 about Russia and WikiLeaks, but failed to turn them over to lawmakers with the rest of his documents on November 3rd. In the letter to Kushner, Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein wrote: "There are several documents that are known to exist but were not included." Kushner has been asked to turn over all relevant documents by November 27th.
