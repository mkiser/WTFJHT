1/ **The Senate GOP tax plan would hurt the poor more than originally thought**, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. If the tax bill becomes law, 4 million Americans are projected to lose health insurance by 2019 and 13 million by 2027. The bill would add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, and Republicans are aiming to have the full Senate vote on the plan as early as this week.

2/ **Trump tweeted that the media should get a "fake news trophy" for its distorted "coverage of your favorite President (me)."** It's not clear what prompted the tweet, but over the weekend Trump criticized CNN International for representing "our nation to the WORLD very poorly." CNN responded: "It's not CNN’s job to represent the U.S. to the world. That’s yours."

3/ **Trump repeated his support for Roy Moore, although Senate Republicans are still trying to force the nominee from the race**. "The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military," Trump tweeted, adding that Democrat Doug Jones "would be a disaster!" A White House official said that Trump, however, would not be traveling to Alabama to campaign for Moore.

* **John Conyers stepped down as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee** amid accusations of sexual harassment. Conyers is the longest-serving member of Congress and has held his seat since 1965. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/26/conyers-stepping-down-from-post-as-ranking-democrat-on-judiciary-panel-259970) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/11/26/lawmakers-call-for-swift-consequences-in-harassment-cases-but-are-divided-over-calls-for-resignation/))

* **Al Franken returned to work following four allegations of sexual misconduct against him**. He said he is "embarrassed and ashamed" and that he doesn’t know if more accusations are coming. ([Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com/ashamed-franken-says-he-ll-return-to-work-on-monday/460108233/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/11/27/al-franken-on-whether-he-will-face-more-groping-allegations-i-dont-know-i-cant-say/))

4/ **Michael Flynn's lawyer notified Trump's legal team last week that they will no longer discuss Robert Mueller's investigation with them**. The move suggests that Flynn may be preparing to cooperate with Mueller's investigation. Flynn’s legal team had previously been sharing information about the investigation with Trump’s lawyers. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/flynn-mueller-russia-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/flynns-lawyer-shuts-down-communications-with-trumps-team-a-sign-he-may-be-cooperating-with-mueller-probe/2017/11/23/75de75ea-d09b-11e7-81bc-c55a220c8cbe_story.html))

* **Michael Flynn may have violated federal law by failing to disclose a Middle Eastern trip on his security clearance renewal application in 2016**. Flynn traveled to Egypt and Israel in 2015 as an advisor to a company hoping to build two dozen nuclear power plants in the region. The plan relied on help from Russians to build the plants and take possession of the spent fuel, which could be used to build a nuclear weapon. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-flynns-role-in-middle-eastern-nuclear-project-could-compound-legal-issues/2017/11/26/51ce7ec8-ce18-11e7-81bc-c55a220c8cbe_story.html))

* **The FBI failed to notify US officials that their personal Gmail accounts** were being targeted by Fancy Bear, a Russian-government-aligned cyberespionage group. Many officials learned of the hacking attempts only when informed by the Associated Press. ([Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/f1a5570b7ce04d39bab00ae3a9041460))

5/ **Today, Flynn's lawyer met with Robert Mueller's team, a possible sign that both sides are discussing a plea deal**. The process would likely include several off-the-record discussions between Flynn and the special counsel's team, as well as an opportunity to make a proffer of evidence that could implicate others.

6/ **The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has two acting directors each claiming control of the agency**. Richard Cordray resigned on Friday, naming Leandra English his deputy director and the presumed acting director. The White House responded by appointing Mick Mulvaney, currently the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to be acting director until Trump decided on a permanent successor. English then filed a lawsuit against Trump in an attempt to block him from appointing Mulvaney. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/us/politics/cfpb-leandra-english-mulvaney.html?_r=0) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cfpb-memo/doughnuts-dueling-memos-factor-in-showdown-over-u-s-consumer-agency-idUSKBN1DR1UD) / [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cfpb-director-suit-20171126-story.html))

7/ **The CFPB's general counsel sided with the Justice Department over Trump's appointment of Mick Mulvaney to temporarily lead the bureau**. Mary McLeod's memo agreed with an earlier memo issued by the Office of Legal Counsel, which supported the Trump administration’s position. The OLC memo, however, was written by Steven Engel, a lawyer who previously represented a Canadian payday lender the CFPB sued in 2015 for using its foreign status to offer US customers  with high-cost loans at odds with state and federal laws. Engel represented NDG Financial Corp. in the case against CFPB as recently as this August.

8/ **The White House is considering banning personal mobile phones while at work**. Officials said the proposal is being driven by cybersecurity concerns. Trump, however, has repeatedly complained about leaks to the press since taking office. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-27/white-house-is-said-to-weigh-personal-mobile-phone-ban-for-staff))

9/ **Trumped referred to Elizabeth Warren as "Pocahontas" during an event honoring Native Americans** who served in World War II. Trump has repeatedly used the nickname to refer to Warren and poke fun at her claim of Native American heritage. Sarah Sanders defended the comment, saying "Pocahontas" is not a racial slur and "the most offensive thing" about the situation was Warren claiming to be Native American. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/361990-trump-calls-warren-pocahontas-at-event-honoring-native-american) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/27/politics/trump-pocahontas-navajo-code-talkers/index.html))
