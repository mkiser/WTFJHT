1/ **The White House plans to force Secretary of State Rex Tillerson out and replace him with Mike Pompeo**, the current CIA director, at the end of the year.

6/ **John McCain said he will vote for the GOP tax bill**, saying he believes the legislation is "far from perfect."

8/ **Trump falsely claimed that the Republican tax bill would cost rich Americans like himself "a fortune."** Trump and his family could save more than $1 billion under the House tax plan that passed two weeks ago.

"This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me," Trump said. "This is not good for me." He added that his "very wealthy friends" were "not so happy with me."
