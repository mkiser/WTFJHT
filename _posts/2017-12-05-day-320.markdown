1/ **Robert Mueller issued a subpoena for the banking records of people affiliated with Trump**. The move forced Deutsche Bank – Trump's biggest lender – to turn over documents related to certain credit transactions and the $300 million Trump owes the lender. Legal experts said it showed Mueller was "following the money" in search of links between the campaign and the Kremlin since Deutsche Bank may have sold some of Trump's mortgage or loans to Russian-owned banks, which could potentially give Russia leverage over Trump. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal lawyers, denied that a subpoena had been issued. Since 1998, Deutsche has helped loan at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with Trump, which he used to build or purchase highest-profile projects in Washington, New York, Chicago and Florida.

* **Trump Jr. asked if the Russian lawyer had evidence of illegal donations to the Clinton Foundation** during the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Natalia Veselnitskaya told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Trump Jr. lost interest after she said she did not have meaningful information about Clinton.

2/ **Paul Manafort was ghostwriting an op-ed with a longtime colleague "based in Russia and assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service" while out on bail last month**. The editorial was related to Manafort's political work for Ukraine. Robert Mueller's investigators argue that Manafort's $10 million unsecured bail agreement should be revisited because it was written while he was on house arrest facing several felony charges, which would have violated a court order to not publicly discuss the case and "casts doubt on Manafort’s willingness to comply with court orders." If the court sides with Mueller, Manafort could remain under house arrest until his trial sometime next year.

3/ **Trump's former deputy national security advisor may have contradicted herself during Senate testimony** about Michael Flynn's contacts with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In July, K.T. McFarland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she did not discuss or have any knowledge of Flynn's contact with Kislyak. A December 29th [email exchange](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html), however, shows McFarland wrote a colleague that Flynn would be speaking with Kislyak later that day.

4/ **House Republicans are prepared to block the legislative promises Mitch McConnell made** to Susan Collins and Jeff Flake in exchange for their votes on the Senate bill. Collins and Flake were assured the Senate would consider legislation to offset the negative effects from repealing the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>'s individual mandate, as well as permanent protections for so-called "Dreamers." A conservative bloc in the House sharply opposes both measures. ([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-republicans-already-shooting-down-tax-bills-promises))

* **Senate Republicans accidentally stripped from their tax bill research and development tax credits companies use to encourage innovation**. The change gave money for lawmakers' other priorities, but could force many companies to lose tax breaks the bill's authors intended to protect.

5/ **Trump is considering plans to create a global, private spy network to circumvent the US intelligence agencies** to counter the alleged "deep state" in the intelligence community, which he believes is attempting to undermine his presidency. Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a retired CIA officer submitted proposals to CIA Director Mike Pompeo and the White House to utilize an army of spies that report directly Trump and Pompeo. The intelligence gathered would not be shared with the rest of the CIA or the larger intelligence community.

6/ **The Republican National Committee resumed its financial support of Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore** after Trump endorsed Moore yesterday. The RNC initially cut ties with Moore after at least five women accused him of sexual assault and unwanted sexual advances as teenage girls decades ago. A senior RNC official said: "The RNC is the political arm of the president and we support the President." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/rnc-roy-moore-alabama/index.html))
