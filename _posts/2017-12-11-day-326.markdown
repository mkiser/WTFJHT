1/ **Three women who previously accused Trump of sexual harassment called for Congress to investigate the allegations**. Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey, and Rachel Crooks said that "a non-partisan investigation is important not just for him but for anybody that has allegations against them, this isn't a partisan issue, this is how women are treated everyday." The White House called the accusations false and "totally disputed in most cases," adding that "the timing and absurdity of these false claims speak volumes."

* **How Trump came around to support an accused child molester**: He doesn't believe the claims leveled by Roy Moore's accusers.

2/ **Nikki Haley: The women who've accused Trump of sexual harassment "should be heard,"** breaking from the administration's assertion that the allegations are false.

3/ **Democratic senators called for Trump's resignation over sexual harassment and assault accusations against him**. Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Jeff Merkley suggested that the standard that brought down Al Franken should be applied to Trump. Kirsten Gillibrand [added](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/politics/trump-resign-gillibrand-sexual-assault/index.html): "Trump has committed assault" and "he should be fully investigated and he should resign."

4/ **Obama called on Alabama voters to reject Roy Moore**. "This one's serious," Obama said in a recorded message intended for black voters whose turnout is critical for Democratic candidate Doug Jones. "You can't sit it out."

6/ **Robert Mueller's investigators are focused on an 18-day timeline related to possible obstruction of justice by Trump**. Sally Yates testified that she told White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26th that Michael Flynn had lied to senior members of the Trump team about his conversations with Russia's ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. Possible obstruction of justice hinges on when Trump knew about Flynn's conversations with Russia's ambassador during the transition and when he learned that Flynn had lied about those conversations to the FBI. Trump fired Flynn on February 13th, saying he did so because he had misled Pence. Mueller is trying to determine why Flynn remained in his job for 18 days after Trump learned of Yates' warning, and is interested in whether Trump directed him to lie to senior officials.

* **Steve Bannon's name has surfaced a handful of times in the special counsel and congressional investigations of Russian interference** in the 2016 presidential election.
