2/ **Roy Moore hasn't conceded the race, saying he will "wait on God and let this process play out."** The Alabama Republican Party said it would not support Moore's push for a recount. Moore trails Jones by more than 20,000 votes. ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/12/13/wait-god-roy-moore-still-hasnt-conceded/947422001/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/as-democrats-add-senate-seat-gop-left-to-bicker-over-what-happened-in-alabama/2017/12/13/61bf59f2-dff6-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html))

3/ **Trump tweets: "I was right" that Roy Moore would "not be able to win" in Alabama because "the deck was stacked against him!"** Trump, however, endorsed Moore after his preferred candidate, Luther Strange, lost in the primary, recording a robocall on Moore's behalf, and holding a campaign-style rally just across the state line in Florida last week.

4/ **Senate Democrats called on Republicans to wait until Doug Jones is seated to vote on the tax bill**. GOP lawmakers expect the two chambers to reach a deal in the coming days with a final vote early next week. The soonest Jones could be seated is December 26th or 27th. The Senate passed the tax bill early this month by a 51 to 49 margin.

5/ **House and Senate Republicans reached an agreement on their joint tax bill**. The House and Senate are expected to vote next week. The agreement would set the top individual tax rate at 37%, down from todayâ€™s 39.6%. The corporate rate would drop to 21% from 37% and would take effect in 2018, rather than 2019.

6/ **Trump pulled two of his judicial nominees** after the Senate Judiciary Committee said the candidates would not be confirmed. Earlier this week Chuck Grassley urged the White House to withdraw the nominations of Brett Talley, who has never tried a case, and to reconsider Jeff Mateer, who has called transgender children part of "Satan's plan." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/brett-talley-trump-nominee-withdraws-295322) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/two-controversial-federal-judge-nominees-will-not-be-confirmed-senate-republican-says/2017/12/13/e3876ffa-e02e-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html))

7/ **Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended Robert Mueller's investigation during a House Judiciary Committee** hearing, saying he hasn't seen "good cause" to fire Mueller. Republicans used the hearing to raise doubts about Mueller's motives after it was discovered that an FBI agent assigned to the investigation sent anti-Trump texts to another FBI official during the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Peter Strzok was removed from the investigation after the texts were discovered. Republicans want a second special counsel to be appointed to investigate how the FBI handled the Clinton investigation.
