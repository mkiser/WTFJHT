1/ **The FCC voted to repeal net neutrality**, which required internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally. The measure passed 3-2 with the Republican appointees supporting repeal and the Democratic appointees opposing. 83% of Americans supported the rules that are in place. Internet providers are now free to speed up services for some apps and websites, while blocking or slowing down others. In Ajit Pai's first 11 months as FCC chairman, he's lifted media ownership limits, eased caps on how much broadband providers can charge business customers, and cut back on a low-income broadband program that was supposed to be expanded. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fcc-is-expected-to-repeal-its-net-neutrality-rules-today-in-a-sweeping-act-of-deregulation/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html))

* **In a letter to FCC chairman Ajit Pai, 18 attorneys general asked the commission to delay the net neutrality vote** pending an investigation into fake comments. Of the 22 million public comments filed with the FCC, 94% of them "were submitted multiple times, and in some cases those comments were submitted many hundreds of thousands of times."

* **The New York attorney general said the net neutrality public comment process was corrupted by more than two million comments  that used stolen identities**.

4/ **Marco Rubio will vote against the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax plan** unless it includes a larger expansion of a child tax credit.

5/ **Omarosa Manigault: There "were a lot of things that I observed during the last year that I was very unhappy with" and "made me uncomfortable."** The former "Apprentice" contestant [reportedly](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364827-omarosa-tripped-white-house-alarms-report) tried to enter the White House residence after a confrontation yesterday with John Kelly, who told her that her employment in the administration would end on January 20th.

6/ **Trump's daily intelligence briefings are often structured to avoid upsetting him**. Russia-related intelligence, specifically, is usually only included in the written assessment and not addressed orally. When it is, the CIA analyst leading the briefing will adjust the presentation's structure in order to soften the impact ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/donald-trump-pursues-vladimir-putin-russian-election-hacking/?tid=a_inl))
