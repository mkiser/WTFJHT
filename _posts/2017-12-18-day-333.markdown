1/ **The FBI warned Trump in 2016 that Russia would try to infiltrate his campaign**. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton received counterintelligence briefings by senior FBI officials, which advised them to alert the FBI to any "suspicious overtures to their campaigns." Trump was "briefed and warned" at the session about potential espionage threats from Russia. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596))

2/ **Robert Mueller obtained "many tens of thousands" of Trump transition emails**, including the emails of Jared Kushner and 11 others. The emails came from the General Services Administration, which hosted the transition email system, and include exchanges about potential appointments, gossip about senators, vulnerabilities of Trump nominees, PR strategies, and policy planning. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-mueller-obtains-tens-of-thousands-of-trump-transition-emails-2517994590.html))

3/ **A lawyer from Trump's transition team accused Robert Mueller of unlawfully obtaining the emails** in a seven-page letter sent to the House and Senate oversight committees. Kory Langhofer argued that the General Services Administration "unlawfully produced" emails which were subject to attorney-client privilege. Peter Carr, a spokesman from Mueller's office, said: "When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process."

4/ **Trump said he is not considering firing Robert Mueller**, but that "my people" are "very upset" with how Mueller obtained his transition team's emails and the situation is "not looking good." Congresswoman Jackie Speier, meanwhile, said "rumors" on Capitol Hill suggest Trump plans to fire Mueller on December 22nd, after Congress leaves Washington for the winter recess. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-wont-fire-mueller-as-campaign-to-discredit-russia-probe-heats-up/2017/12/17/801e8cce-e348-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/17/politics/trump-mueller-very-upset-emails/index.html) / [KQED](https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/12/15/congresswoman-speier-says-republicans-trying-to-shut-down-russia-probe/))

* **The cooperation between Trump's lawyers and Robert Mueller is fracturing**. As the investigation has reached deeper into Trump's inner circle, Trump's lawyers and supporters have increased their attacks on Mueller. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/politics/trump-mueller-transition-emails.html))

5/ **Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are trying to wrap up their Russia probe by the end of the year**. Democrats have requested as many as 30 additional interviews with new witnesses, but none have been scheduled beyond the end of this month. Some witnesses are scheduled to be interviewed in New York this week, leaving Democrats to choose between attending those depositions or voting on the tax bill coming before the House. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/politics/house-intelligence-committee-russia-interference.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-prepare-wrap-contentious-russia-investigation-n830561))

6/ **Trump has been telling people close to him that he expects Robert Mueller to clear him soon**. His allies, meanwhile, are worried he's not taking the threat of the probe seriously enough. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/politics/trump-russia-investigation/index.html))

7/ **Trump unveiled his "America First" foreign policy**, presenting both Russia and China as "revisionist powers" who "want to shape a world antithetical to US values and interests." Trump's strategy has four organizing principles: protect the American homeland, protect American prosperity, preserve peace through strength, and advance US influence. Trump attacked past administrations on immigration, the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord, trade pacts, and more. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-sets-out-national-security-strategy-of-principled-realism-and-global-competition/2017/12/18/7edcb0be-e412-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/politics/trump-national-security-strategy/index.html))

8/ **The Trump administration ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop using "diversity," "fetus," "transgender," "vulnerable," "entitlement," "science-based," and "evidence-based"** in their 2018 budget documents. "Certain words" in the CDC's budget drafts have been sent back to the agency for correction. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html))

9/ **Chuck Schumer will force a Senate vote to reinstate the FCC's net neutrality rules**. Congress can overturn an agency by invoking the Congressional Review Act with a simple majority vote, without the possibility of a filibuster. The Republican majority will be 51-49 after Alabama Democrat Doug Jones is sworn in. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she opposes the net neutrality repeal. ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/there-will-be-a-senate-vote-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-schumer-says/))

poll/ **50% of voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress**, while 39% want Republicans in charge.
