1/ **The House will vote on tax reform today**. The Senate will vote either later today or tomorrow. Party-line votes are expected in both chambers and passage appears certain of the biggest overhaul of the tax system in more than 30 years. The bill would add $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade and deepen the income gap between rich and poor. The legislation also repeals the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that most Americans buy health insurance coverage or face a federal fine. Paul Ryan said the bill "is about expanding opportunities for people who are striving to make the most of their lives."

> **UPDATE:**
>
> **The House passed the $1.5 trillion GOP tax bill** that cuts tax rates for corporations, provides new breaks for private businesses, and reorganizes the individual tax code. The Senate is expected to pass the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act as soon as Tuesday night, which Trump could sign into law before the end of the week. Lawmakers voted 227-203.

* **The GOP tax bill will impact high-tax, high-cost-of-living, big cities most** by capping the state and local income and property deductions at $10,000. Capping the benefit will potentially expose residents of those areas to a higher tax liability and reduce their property values.

2/ **The GOP bill would lower taxes for 95% of Americans in 2018, but within a decade 53% of Americans will pay more in taxes under the plan** with 82.8% of the bill's benefit going to the top 1%. In 2018, the highest earners on average will receive a larger tax cut than those making less. Those earning between $49,000 and $86,000 will receive an average cut of about $900, or roughly 1%. Those earning more than $733,000 would receive a cut of about $51,000, or roughly 6.9%.
