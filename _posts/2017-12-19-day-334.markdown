1/ **The House will vote on tax reform today**. The Senate will vote either later today or tomorrow. Party-line votes are expected in both chambers and passage appears certain of the biggest overhaul of the tax system in more than 30 years. The bill would add $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade and deepen the income gap between rich and poor. The legislation also repeals the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that most Americans buy health insurance coverage or face a federal fine. Paul Ryan said the bill "is about expanding opportunities for people who are striving to make the most of their lives."
