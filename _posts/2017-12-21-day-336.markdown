Don McGahn learned on December 29, 2016, that Flynn had counseled Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, not to retaliate against economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.

Hillary Clinton, however, wasn't involved in the decision while secretary of state, the State Department official who approved the deal has confirmed. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/prosecutors-ask-fbi-agents-info-uranium-one-deal-n831436))

9/ **A secret group of House Republicans has been investigating Justice Department and FBI officials** for what they believe is corruption as it relates to the handling of a dossier describing allegations of Trump's ties to the Kremlin.
