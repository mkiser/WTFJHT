1/ **Trump claimed the "tainted" FBI is using the "bogus," "pile of garbage" dossier to go after him**. The dossier contains allegations about Trump's connections to Russia and possible coordination between the campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Many of the details contained in the dossier have been verified.

2/ **Andrew McCabe plans to retire in March when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits**. Trump attacked the FBI's deputy director on Twitter, saying McCabe is "racing the clock to retire with full benefits."

McCabe cannot be fired by Trump.
