1/ **Trump: The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a> makes the US "look very bad"** and "puts the country in a very bad position." The comment came during an impromptu 30-minute interview with The New York Times at his golf club in West Palm Beach. Trump insisted 16 times that there has been "no collusion" discovered by Robert Mueller's investigation. Additional quotes below. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-mueller-russia-china-north-korea.html))

1. **On collusion with Russia**: "There is no collusion" and even if there was collusion, "it's not a crime."

2. **On reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails**: "I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department."

3. **On China**: "China's hurting us very badly on trade, but I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war."

4. **On North Korea**: "...a nuclear menace..."

3/ **Trump tweets that the US could use some "good old Global Warming" right now** while most of the Northeast is experiencing record-breaking cold weather. Weather and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-epa/">climate change</a> are two different things: Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions, while <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-epa/">climate change</a> is how the atmosphere acts over long periods of time.
