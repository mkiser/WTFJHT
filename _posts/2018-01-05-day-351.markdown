1/ **Trump ordered the White House's top lawyer to stop Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/trump-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a>**, saying he expected his attorney general to protect him. Don McGahn unsuccessfully lobbied Sessions to remain in charge in March 2017. Trump reportedly erupted in anger in front of several White House officials. The previously unreported details have legal experts suggesting that there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying Trump to a possible crime of obstruction. Robert Mueller's investigation is currently investigating whether Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
