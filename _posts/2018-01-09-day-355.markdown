2/ **Dianne Feinstein released the full transcript of Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee** regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

7/ **Trump said he would support a two-phase, bipartisan immigration deal in order to avoid a government shutdown**. A potential deal would first address DACA protections and border security with what he called a "bill of love," followed by a comprehensive immigration bill. Trump said such a deal must include money for his border wall and strict immigration limits. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/trump-daca-immigration.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/63df959272f94f908b7a27ba55553df9/Trump-suggests-2-phase-immigration-deal-for-'Dreamers'))
