1/ **A federal judge blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end DACA**, the Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children to remain in the United States. A San Francisco-based U.S. District Court judge said Jeff Sessions' claim that the program is illegal was "based on a flawed legal premise," and ordered the administration to resume accepting DACA renewal applications. Trump responded, calling the court system "broken and unfair." Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that the decision was "outrageous."

2/ **Trump declined to commit to an interview with Robert Mueller when asked at a news conference today**. He said it "seems unlikely," but that "we'll see what happens."

3/ **Trump's personal attorney filed lawsuits against Fusion GPS and BuzzFeed over the Steele dossier**. The lawsuits, one in federal and the other in state court, both claim that the dossier contained "false and defamatory" allegations against Trump that resulted in "harm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities."

* **Trump said his administration would take a "strong look" at libel laws**. He criticized the current laws as a "disgrace" and a "sham." He pledged to make it easier for people to sue news organizations and publishers for defamation.

4/ **A panel of federal judges ruled that North Carolina's congressional map was unconstitutional** on the grounds that Republicans drew the map with the intention of gaining a political advantage. The ruling, which imperils Republican seats in the upcoming election, marks the first time a federal court has blocked a congressional map on partisan gerrymandering grounds. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html))

5/ **A member of Trump's National Security Council proposed withdrawing U.S. forces from Eastern Europe as a way to please Putin** during the first months of the Trump presidency. Kevin Harrington's proposal, which was rejected, is the first known instance of senior Trump aides attempting to alter U.S. military actions to please Putin.

6/ **The Trump administration waived fines for Deutsche Bank and four other multinational banks convicted of manipulating global interest rates**. Trump owes Deutsche at least $130 million in loans that were originally worth $300 million. The German bank was also [fined](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/31/Day-12/) $425 million by New York State for laundering $10 billion out of Russia.

7/ **The Interior Department removed Florida "from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms"** and won't allow oil drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said drilling would be "off the table" when it comes to waters. The move, following pressure from Republican Gov. Rick Scott, exempts Florida from the Trump administration's plan to open up offshore drilling in coastal waters.

8/ **The White House plans to destroy the data collected for Trump's voter fraud commission** rather than giving it to the Department of Homeland Security.
