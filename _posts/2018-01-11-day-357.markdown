1/ **Trump questioned why the US would admit people from "shithole countries" like Haiti or African** after lawmakers floated the idea of restoring protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as part of a bipartisan immigration deal. "Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?" Trump said, suggesting that the U.S. should instead bring more people from countries like Norway than African or Haiti. The White House didn't deny Trump that called those countries "shitholes." In a June meeting on immigration, Trump said Haitians "all have AIDS" and complained that Nigerians would never "go back to their huts" in Africa.

2/ **The Trump administration will let states require people to work for Medicaid**. Under the new guidance, states can now require Medicaid beneficiaries to work, volunteer or participate in job training. The elderly, disabled, pregnant women, and children are excluded.

3/ **The House reauthorized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act**, which allows the US intelligence community to collect Americans' email, text messages, photos, and other electronic communication without a warrant. The legislation, which passed 256 to 164, renews the program for six years and will now head to the Senate.

4/ **Trump sent a series of confusing tweets about his position on the bill after a Fox News analyst appealed directly to Trump on-air, urging him to oppose the bill**. First, Trump tweeted in apparent opposition to the bill that the "controversial FISA ACT ... may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?" About 90 minutes later, Trump reversed course, tweeting that "today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!"
