1/ **Robert Mueller wants to interview Trump in the coming weeks about his decisions to fire Michael Flynn and James Comey**. Trump's legal team wants his testimony to be part face-to-face interview and part written statement. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-seeks-to-question-trump-about-flynn-and-comey-departures/2018/01/23/e6652db6-0068-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html))

2/ **Jeff Sessions was questioned by Mueller's team last week** as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the election and whether Trump had obstructed justice since taking office. As attorney general, Sessions was involved in the firing of James Comey and it's the first time that special counsel investigators have interviewed a member of Trump's cabinet. Sessions was not under subpoena and was questioned for several hours.

3/ **Mueller's team reportedly interviewed Comey last year**. The interview focused on a series of memos Comey wrote about his meetings with Trump, documenting what he perceived as improper efforts to influence an investigation. In one memo, Comey said that Trump had asked him to end the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/jeff-sessions-special-counsel-russia.html))

4/ **The head of the FBI threatened to resign after Jeff Sessions pressured him to fire Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.** Christopher Wray told Sessions that he would resign if McCabe was removed from his position. Sessions and White House Counsel Don McGahn agreed that the issue wasn't worth losing the FBI director over. Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly attacked McCabe – a Comey appointee – for his role in the Clinton investigation. In December, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/mccabe-fbi-trump-russia.html) that McCabe "is expected to retire after he becomes eligible for his pension \[in\] early \[2018\].

5/ **Jeff Sessions ordered an investigation into the missing text messages exchanged between two FBI staffers that referred to Trump as an "idiot" and a "loathsome human."** The texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page are among a batch of messages that the FBI failed to properly archive because of a software update issue with Samsung 5 phones. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-texts/u-s-attorney-general-orders-probe-of-fbi-agents-text-messages-idUSKBN1FC2OQ))

6/ **Chuck Schumer retracted his offer to give Trump $1.6 billion in wall funding in exchange for a DACA deal**. Trump turned down the deal last week, prompting a three-day government shutdown.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/23/chuck-schumer-trump-wall-offer-359156))

7/ **A Michigan man was arrested after allegedly threatening to shoot and kill CNN employees.** The FBI launched an investigation after the man reportedly called CNN 22 times about a week ago and said, among other things, "Fake news. I'm coming to gun you all down." ([WGCL-TV](http://www.cbs46.com/story/37323169/feds-man-threatened-to-kill-cnn-employees) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/media/370207-man-arrested-after-threatening-to-kill-cnn-employees))
