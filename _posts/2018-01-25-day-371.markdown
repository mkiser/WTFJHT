1/ **Trump said he's willing to consider a path to citizenship for DREAMers**, undercutting his administration's messaging. Trump's off-the-cuff comment – to allow young undocumented immigrants to "morph" into citizens after 10 to 12 years – sent White House staffers scrambling in what one official called a "fire drill."
