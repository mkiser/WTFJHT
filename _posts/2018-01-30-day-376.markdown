1/ **The FBI is investigating a second Trump-Russia dossier**. This one, written by former journalist Cody Shearer, was provided to the FBI by Christopher Steele in October 2016. Steele warned that he could not vouch for the accuracy of the memo, but provided a copy because it corroborated what he had separately heard from his own sources. The FBI is still assessing details in the "Shearer memo," which suggests investigators have taken some aspect of it seriously. Both documents allege that Trump was compromised during a 2013 trip to Moscow that involved prostitutes urinating on a bed where the Obamas once stayed.

2/ **Trump will not impose new sanctions on Russia because the threat is already "serving as a deterrent,"** a State Department official said. A bipartisan bill overwhelmingly passed in July imposes penalties on companies doing "significant" business with Russian defense and intelligence entities. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: "We estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions."

3/ **The US Treasury published a list of Russian oligarchs and senior officials at the Kremlin as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act**. The report includes 114 senior political figures with close ties to Putin and 96 oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more. The list is designed to shame individuals and put them on notice that they could be the subject of future sanctions. The names in the unclassified version of the report were derived from Forbes’ ranking of the “200 richest businessmen in Russia 2017.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/29/politics/trump-russia-sanctions/index.html) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnhudson/trump-administration-admits-it-cribbed-forbes-magazine-to?utm_term=.hr7yODEQW2))

4/ **The Congress-mandated sanctions report was lifted from the Forbes "200 richest businessmen in Russia 2017" list**, a Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed.  Almost all 96 oligarchs listed in the government-issued report appear in the Forbes' ranking.

5/ **Betsy DeVos wants to put student loan money onto prepaid debit cards**. The move would allow the Education Department to monitor, and potentially control, how and when students spend excess federal student loan and grant money.

poll/ **Trump's approval rating was above 50% in 12 states for the entirety of 2017.** By comparison, Obama had an approval rate of 50% or greater in 41 states in his first year in office. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/politics/trump-approval-ratings-gallup/index.html))
