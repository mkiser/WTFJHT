1/ **Hope Hicks allegedly told Trump that the emails involving Trump Jr. and the Trump Tower meeting "will never get out" because only a few people have access to them**. The White House communications director's comment was in response to Mark Corallo, who served as the spokesman for Trump's legal team, saying the statement they drafted aboard Air Force One would backfire when documents surface that the meeting was setup to get political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russians – and not about Russian adoptions. Corallo believed Hicks' comment indicated that she could be contemplating obstructing justice. Corallo will tell Robert Mueller about the previously undisclosed conference call with Trump and Hicks when he meets with the special counsel's team sometime in the next two weeks. Corallo resigned from Trump's legal team in July.

2/ **The White House is worried that FBI Director Christopher Wray will quit if The Memo™ is released**. Wray has "[grave concerns](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/01/31/day-377/#1-the-fbi-said-in-a-statement-that-i)" that "material omissions of fact" make the document inaccurate. Trump is expected to approve the release of the memo on Friday, which alleges surveillance abuse by the FBI, without the bureau's requested redactions.

3/ **Trump Jr. tweeted that Andrew McCabe was "fired" because of the contents of The Memo™**.

4/ **Adam Schiff accused Devin Nunes of giving Trump a "secretly altered" version of The Memo™** which contained "substantive" changes that had not been approved by the House Intelligence Committee.
