1/ **Top White House officials knew about the allegations of Rob Porter's verbal and physical abuse for months**. White House Counsel Donald McGahn knew in January 2017 that accusations by Porter's ex-wives could threaten his security clearance. John Kelly learned this fall that the domestic violence claims were delaying Porter's security clearance after the FBI flagged its findings to the White House. He gave Porter more responsibilities. Until his resignation on Wednesday, Porter was one of Trump's most senior aides. The White House has said Kelly was not "fully aware" of the abuse until this week.

* **John Kelly sent a memo to White House staffers Thursday night addressing the allegations made against Rob Porter**. Kelly wrote, "While we are all processing the shocking and troubling allegations made against a former White House staffer, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/08/politics/john-kelly-staff-email-domestic-violence/index.html))

2/ **Trump is frustrated with Hope Hicks' role in the Porter scandal and is placing much of the blame on John Kelly**. Trump is questioning the White House's response and has told associates that he thinks Hicks put her romantic relationship with Porter ahead of his priorities. Trump was not consulted on the White House statement, which defended Porter. Kelly, meanwhile, initially defended Porter and urged him to fight the allegations and to remain in the job. But after graphic photos emerged of the abuse, Kelly accepted Porter's resignation.

3/ **Meanwhile, Trump said the allegations of domestic abuse are "very sad," but that he wishes Rob Porter "well" because "he did a very good job while he was in the White House**. We hope he has a wonderful career ahead of him." Trump added that believes Porter is innocent, because Porter said "very strongly" that he was innocent.

4/ **Trump has recently asked advisers what they think of Mick Mulvaney as a possible replacement for John Kelly as chief of staff**. Mulvaney currently holds two posts as director of the White House budget office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/kelly-trump.html))

5/ **Trump doesn't read the President's Daily Brief**, which outlines the most important information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from around the world. Instead, he receives an oral briefing of select intelligence issues, because reading is not Trump's preferred "style of learning."

6/ **The government shut down for five hours last night** for the second time in three weeks. The House passed a spending bill late last night, which Trump signed into law early Friday morning. The measure keeps the government open until March 23. The bill also increases federal spending for the military, domestic, and disaster relief programs by hundreds of billions of dollars.
