1/ **Rachel Brand quit the Justice Department in part over fears that she'd have to take over the Russia investigation** if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The Justice Department's No. 3 attorney had been unhappy with her job for months, telling friends that she felt overwhelmed and unsupported in her job, primarily because four of the 13 divisions she oversaw as the associate attorney general remained unfilled.

2/ **The White House proposed a $4.4 trillion federal budget that would add $7 trillion to the deficit over ten years**. The plan calls for cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs in favor of higher spending on a "ready, larger, and more lethal military," $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, and $200 billion over the next decade for infrastructure spending. The State Department budget would be cut by 27% and the EPA would be cut by 34%. The budget will likely be ignored by Congress, which passed its own two-year spending plan last week.

3/ **Trump's infrastructure plan will provide up to $200 billion in federal funding to encourage cities and states to invest in roads, bridges, and other building projects**. The goal is to incentivize $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next 10 years without investing significant federal funding, while also reducing the time required to obtain environmental permits for the projects.

Led by Trump appointee Mick Mulvaney, the CFPB will operate for the years 2018 through 2022 under a "revised mission and vision of the bureau" that will call upon the agency to "fulfill its statutory responsibilities but go no further."

5/ **Scott Pruitt often uses taxpayer funds to fly first-class and stay at luxury hotels, using unspecified security concerns as justification**.

7/ **Jeff Sessions called sheriffs a "critical part" of the "Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement"** during a speech at the National Sheriffs' Association.
