1/ **Trump, in a tweet, suggested that students and neighbors should have reported the Florida shooter to authorities**, because there were "so many signs" that the shooter "was mentally disturbed." The FBI was warned in September about a possible school shooting after a YouTube user named Nikolas Cruz – the same name as the shooter who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School – left a comment that read: "Im going to be a professional school shooter." The FBI said it had investigated the comment, but was unable to identify the person who posted it.

4/ **The admission that Michael Cohen facilitated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels is raising legal and ethical questions**.

6/ **The bipartisan immigration bill failed in the Senate after Trump threatened to veto the deal**, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants and allot $25 billion for border security. Negotiators in both parties reached a tentative agreement yesterday, but the measure fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed today. The final vote was 54-45.
