1/ **National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster could leave the White House** after months of personal tension between him and Trump.

2/ **A Trump-appointed federal judge who donated to the Trump campaign and worked on his presidential transition team is refusing to recuse himself from overseeing a legal battle involving Fusion GPS**, the research firm that produced the dossier of intelligence that contains claims Trump has ties to Russia.

3/ **Robert Mueller filed additional criminal charges against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates**.

4/ **The NRA blamed the Florida school shooting on a "failure of school security" and a "failure of family."** Wayne LaPierre, CEO and vice president of the NRA, accused Democrats of "exploit\[ing\] tragedy for political gain," blamed "rogue" leadership of the FBI, and attacked the left for promoting a "socialist agenda" intended to strip firearms away from law-abiding citizens.

5/ **In 2016, Trump tweeted that he didn't want "guns in classrooms." Yesterday, he made a "concealed carry" proposal to arm teachers. Today, Trump tweeted that he never said he wanted to "give teachers guns**." In the same tweet, however, he suggested that the government would "look at the possibility of giving 'concealed guns to gun adept teachers.'" And, at a White House "listening session," Trump said that "gun-free" school zones make it like "going in for ice cream" for school shooters. While on Twitter, he promised that "ATTACKS WOULD END!" with his strategy of arming "highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive."

6/ **Trump's listening session talking points had to remind him to say "I hear you"** and to ask "What would you most want me to know about your experience?" A photographer captured a picture of the talking points Trump was given for Wednesday's listening session with survivors of the school shooting in Florida.

7/ **Marco Rubio and the NRA were repeatedly heckled after they refused to back a full ban on military-style assault weapons** while discussing gun violence with the high school students who survived the shooting in Parkland, Florida. Rubio said he supported legislation to raise the legal age to purchase a rifle to 21 and to create gun violence restraining orders. He said he was "reconsidering" support for a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines, and that he opposed Trump's proposal to arm teachers or put armed security in classrooms.

8/ **Paul Ryan removed the chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission**. The House speaker will now recommend a nominee for the commissioner post, which Trump will formally nominate. The reason for passing on Matthew Masterson for a second four-year term, and whether the decision originated with Ryan or the White House, is unclear.
