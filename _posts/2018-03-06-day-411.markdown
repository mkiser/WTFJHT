1/ **Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act on two occasions**, the Office of Special Counsel said as it referred its findings to Trump "for appropriate disciplinary action." In her official capacity, Conway endorsed and advocated against political candidates during two television appearances in 2017. The Hatch Act prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. The OSC is not affiliated with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

2/ **Trump tweets "there is no chaos" in the White House, but there are "some people that I want to change"** because he is "always seeking perfection." The tweet comes a week after Trump called Jeff Sessions "disgraceful," Hope Hicks resigned, and Jared Kushner's security clearance was downgraded.

3/ **Trump believes Gary Cohn will resign if the administration follows through with tariffs on imported steel and aluminum**. Trump's top economic advisor has been working to stop the tariffs that threaten to cause a global trade war. Yesterday, [Paul Ryan said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-nafta.html) he is "extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war" while urging "the White House to not advance with this plan." The tariffs, Ryan's spokeswoman said, would "jeopardize" the economic gains from the recent Republican tax cuts.

4/ **Sam Nunberg says he'll probably cooperate with Robert Mueller's subpoena after all.** Yesterday, the former Trump aide appeared on multiple cable news programs to announce his plans to defy the special prosecutor's demands. Nunberg conceded that he'll likely find a way to comply with the requests for testimony and documents. "I'm going to end up cooperating with them," Nunberg said. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/d77276cfdf0a4f3b9c526363ddbeb7c4) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/nunberg-now-says-hell-cooperate-with-investigators-1520300941-e164aac2-e662-4684-a8c2-8123e25e77ce.html))

5/ **The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee wants to interview Nunberg as part of its Russia investigation**. Adam Schiff said Nunberg's assertion that Trump knew about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting before it occurred is an area that the committee needs to explore. Nunberg said he would be willing to testify. "I would go there, sure."

6/ **Kim Jong-un may be willing to negotiate with the U.S. on abandoning its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees**, according to South Korean president Moon Jae-in. North Korea would suspend all nuclear and missile tests while the negotiations are in progress. It's the first time North Korea has indicated that it's willing to negotiate away its nuclear weapons. Trump tweeted: "We will see what happens!" ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/asia/north-korea-south-nuclear-weapons.html))

7/ **The Trump administration will allow hunters to import elephant trophies on a "case-by-case" basis**, breaking Trump's earlier pledge to maintain the Obama-era protections. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued a memorandum last week withdrawing its 2007 Endangered Species Act findings for elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia, saying that "the findings are no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies." Trump previously called trophy hunting a "horror show." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/376839-trump-admin-to-consider-elephant-trophy-imports-on-case-by-case))
