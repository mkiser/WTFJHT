1/ **Students from more than 3,000 schools walked out today to demand stricter gun regulation**, including bans on assault weapons and expanded background checks. The National School Walkout started at 10 a.m. ET and will continue across the country at 10 a.m. in each time zone, sparked by last month's school shooting in Florida. The protests will last for 17 minutes to honor each of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School one month ago. Some school districts have said they will discipline students who participate in the walkouts. "Change never happens without backlash," Pope High School senior Kara Litwin said. "This is a movement, this is not simply a moment, and this is only the first step in our long process."

2/ **A teacher who is also a reserve police officer injured three students after accidentally firing a gun inside a California classroom during a class devoted to public safety**. Immediately before the gun fired, Dennis Alexander told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn't loaded as he pointed it to the ceiling. "I think a lot of questions on parents' minds are, why a teacher would be pointing a loaded firearm at the ceiling in front of students," the district superintendent said. *\[Editor's note: Why would a teacher be bringing a loaded firearm to school?\]* ([KSBW](http://www.ksbw.com/article/seaside-high-teacher-accidentally-fires-gun-in-class/19426017) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/14/teacher-accidentally-discharges-firearm-in-calif-classroom-he-was-trained-in-gun-use/))

3/ **In a separate incident, a school resource officer with the Alexandria, Virginia, Police Department accidentally fired his weapon at George Washington Middle School**. The officer was inside his office at the time, and a department representative declined to say whether the officer had taken his gun out of his holster. No one, including the officer, was injured.

4/ **The House of Representatives passed a school safety bill** by a vote of 407-10 to help schools and local law enforcement prevent gun violence. The bill provides training for school officials and local law enforcement to respond to mental health crises, as well as money to develop systems for reporting threats. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.

5/ **Democrat Conor Lamb is narrowly leading Republican Rick Saccone in a Pennsylvania special election that's still too close to call**. With 100% of votes counted, Lamb has a 627-vote lead over Saccone in a district that Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points and that was once considered an easy win for Republicans. The district will not exist in 2019, however, because the State Supreme Court ruled in January that Pennsylvania's House map was gerrymandered unlawfully and district lines have been redrawn. Whoever wins will be forced to run in a new district in November.

* **Republicans don't plan to concede in the contested special election in Pennsylvania**. The National Republican Congressional Committee said it is "not ruling out a recount." Democrat Conor Lamb holds a lead of less than 700 votes over Republican Rick Saccone. There are still about 203 absentee ballots and then additional provisional and military ballots left to be counted.

6/ **Emails show Ben Carson and his wife selected the $31,000 furniture set for his Department of Housing and Urban Development dining room**, undercutting claims by his spokesman that he had little or no involvement in the purchase. An August email, with the subject line "Secretary's dining room set needed," refers to "printouts of the furniture the Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/emails-ben-candy-carson-dining-set/index.html))

7/ **The family of a slain DNC staffer filed a lawsuit against Fox News**, an investigative reporter, and one of the network's frequent guests over a story about Seth Rich and their allegations that he was involved in a conspiracy.

8/ **Trey Gowdy contradicted his own Republican-led House Intelligence Committee's findings in the Russia probe**. Gowdy said Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election was motivated in part "by a desire" to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy. The committee disagreed with the intelligence community's assessment "with respect to Putin's supposed preference for candidate Trump." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/gop-rep-gowdy-says-russia-hurt-hillary-clinton-campaign.html))

9/ **Trump is open to a short-term DACA deal in exchange for border wall funding**. One idea under consideration is a three-year extension of DACA in exchange for three years of wall funding. Trump canceled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September.

### Notables.

1. **Trump floated the idea of developing a "Space Force,"** a new branch of the military that would operate outside of earth's atmosphere.
