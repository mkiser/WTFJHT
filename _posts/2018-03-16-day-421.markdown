1/ **Trump plans to remove national security adviser H.R. McMaster and is currently considering potential replacements**. Trump plans to take his time with the transition in order to avoid humiliating McMaster and ensure he has a strong replacement. Other Trump officials, like Ben Carson and Mick Mulvaney, are also rumored to be on the chopping block. "There will always be change," Trump said. "I think you want to see change. I want to also see different ideas." Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, disputed the story that Trump had decided to fire McMaster, tweeting: "Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster — contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC."

2/ **Trump is on track to hire multiple cable news personalities to fill out his cabinet**. Trump has discussed having Fox News contributor John Bolton succeed McMaster as national security adviser. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin could be replaced with Pete Hegseth, the co-host of *Fox and Friends Weekend.* Trump has already named Larry Kudlow to replace Gary Cohn as his chief economic adviser.

3/ **John Kelly, whose departure has been rumored to be imminent, has settled on a temporary truce with Trump**. After a meeting with Kelly, Trump told advisers that his chief of staff was "100% safe." Kelly told colleagues that the two of them have patched things up for the moment. "I'm in," Kelly told his staff. Later, Kelly speculated that all the recent news about possible staffing changes is because Trump has been talking with people outside of the White House when he's not around.

4/ **Stormy Daniels was threatened with "physical harm" in response to her claims that she had an affair with Trump in 2006**. When Mika Brzezinski asked on MSNBC's *Morning Joe* "Was she threatened \[with\] physical harm?," Daniels' lawyer said yes but didn't say what the specific threats were, or whether Trump was the one who personally threatened her. During a CNN interview later in the day, Daniels' lawyer confirmed that some of the threats have taken place during the Trump presidency. Daniels' interview with *60 Minutes* is set to air on March 25.
