1/ **Trump has discussed firing one of his lawyers, while another is contemplating resignation**. Ty Cobb, who has urged Trump to cooperate with Mueller's investigation, appears to be on the chopping block, while John Dowd has considered leaving the team because Trump ignores his legal advice. Trump tweeted that he's "VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow," although he recently met with Emmet Flood, the lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings. Trump also added Joseph E. diGenova to his legal team on Monday. DiGenova is a regular Fox News commentator who has suggested that the FBI and the Justice Department conspired to deny Trump his "civil rights."

* **A seasoned, high-profile litigator declined to join Trump's legal team**. Theodore Olson served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and has more experience on landmark cases than any of Trump's current lawyers. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-legal-team-seeks-to-add-gravitas-with-offer-to-star-gop-attorney-theodore-b-olson/2018/03/20/571f1e46-2c41-11e8-8ad6-fbc50284fce8_story.html))

2/ **Paul Ryan says he received "assurances" that firing Robert Mueller is "not even under consideration."** The House Speaker did not elaborate on the assurances. In January, Mitch McConnell declined to take up proposed legislation to protect Mueller because he knew of no "official" White House effort to undermine him. Today, McConnell [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/mitch-mcconnell-mueller-defense-schumer/index.html) legislation was "not necessary" to protect Mueller against the threat of being fired by Trump. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/paul-ryan-assurances-mueller-not-fired/index.html))

3/ **Stormy Daniels passed a polygraph exam in 2011 about her relationship with Trump**. The examiner found there was a 99% probability Daniels was telling the truth when she said she had unprotected sex with Trump in 2006. The White House and Trump's attorney have denied that the president had a sexual relationship with Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/lie-detector-test-shows-stormy-daniels-truthful-about-trump-affair-n858281))

4/ **A former Playboy model, who alleges she had an affair with Trump, is suing to be released from a 2016 legal agreement requiring her silence**. Karen McDougal is suing American Media Inc., the company that owns The National Enquirer, which paid her $150,000 to buy her story and bury it, a practice known as "catch and kill." David Pecker is the CEO of American Media Inc. and a friend of Trump's. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/ex-playboy-model-sues-to-break-silence-on-trump.html))

5/ **A Manhattan Supreme Court judge ruled that Trump must face a defamation lawsuit by a former "Apprentice" contestant** and that his job as commander-in-chief does not give him immunity from the lawsuit. Trump had argued that presidents are shielded from civil litigation in state courts under the US Constitution's supremacy clause. The assertion has never been fully tested by the courts, however, making the ruling a first-of-its-kind decision. ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2018/03/20/former-apprentice-contestant-can-sue-trump-for-defamation/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-rules-defamation-case-against-trump-may-proceed/2018/03/20/561d1d44-f498-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/379345-judge-denies-trump-immunity-rules-he-must-face-defamation))

### Dept. of #FacebookExit.

1. **Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission**, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. Cambridge Analytica – owned by Robert Mercer and headed by Steve Bannon at the time – hired Aleksandr Kogan, who built "a very standard vanilla Facebook app," which would scrape information from participants' profiles and those of their friends under the premise that the company was collecting information for academic purposes. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election))

3. **Facebook's chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, is leaving the company following disagreements among top Facebook executives** over their response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections and potential interference in the 2018 midterms.

Stamos oversaw Facebook's security team, which was once 120 people, but is currently down to three people. Stamos plans to leave the company by August.

8. **Facebook's stock fell about 7% on Monday**, cutting about $37 billion off the value of the company. Mark Zuckerberg personally lost about $5 billion in net worth. ([CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/news/companies/zuckerberg-net-worth/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-is-pummeled-by-user-data-blowback-1521561322))

### Dept. of Swamp Things.

1. **Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will testify before the House Appropriations Committee about her "Education Reform Plan,"** which calls for a 5% spending cut and eliminates dozens of programs. It includes a $1 billion school choice proposal. Department staff said DeVos tried to withhold information in the budget justifications submitted to Congress. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary-devos-reorganization-plan-union.html))

2. **Ben Carson defended the purchase of a $31,000 dining set**, telling the House Appropriations Committee that the furniture was necessary because "people were stuck by nails, and a chair had collapsed with someone sitting in it."

([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/hud-s-carson-denies-trying-to-mislead-public-in-furniture-furor) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/ben-carson-hud-dining-room.html))

4. **A new Mississippi law bans most abortions after 15 weeks' gestation with no exceptions for rape or incest**.

([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mississippi-gov-signs-nation-s-toughest-abortion-restrictions-n858031))

5. **A federal judge temporarily blocked the new Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks**. The temporary restraining order was requested by the state's only abortion clinic. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/6c55a98736194980a29ddeba3ec71e00))
