1/ **Trump won't hire two attorneys who were supposed to join his legal team after all**. The appointments were announced last week, but Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement that "conflicts prevent Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing from joining the president’s special counsel legal team." He added: "Those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the president in other legal matters." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-digenova-toensing.html))

2/ **Trump's personal legal team is down to one member** as he struggles to find lawyers willing to represent him. Jay Sekulow is the only personal lawyer for Trump working full time on Robert Mueller's investigation. He is assisted by Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer paid by taxpayers to represent the institution of the presidency rather than Trump personally. John Dowd, who had been leading the team handling the Russia inquiry, resigned last week after strategy disputes with Trump, while Marc Kasowitz's role was reduced after a series of clashes with Trump over the summer. Emmet Flood, the lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, said he will not represent Trump if Kasowitz has any role on the team, and another, Theodore Olson, declined to represent Trump. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-digenova.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-another-blow-to-trumps-efforts-to-combat-russia-probe-digenova-will-no-longer-join-legal-team/2018/03/25/8ac8c8d2-3038-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html))

3/ **Trump expects to "make one or two major changes to his government very soon,"** according to Trump's friend Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax. "He told me he thinks the White House is operating like a smooth machine -- his words," said Ruddy, and that Trump is "perplexed by all these reports that there’s chaos at the White House or mass staff changes." ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-make-major-government-presidents-friend/story?id=53993032))

4/ **Stormy Daniels said she was threatened not to speak about her affair with Trump**, Daniels told Anderson Cooper during her 60 Minutes interview. She also discussed statements and denials she previously made about the affair. After the interview aired, Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen sent Daniels a "cease and desist" letter, demanding that she stop speaking out about her relationship with Trump. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stormy-daniels-describes-her-alleged-affair-with-donald-trump-60-minutes-interview/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-daniels-cohen/trump-lawyer-tells-porn-star-cease-and-desist-after-interview-fox-idUSKBN1H21E2))

5/ **Trump "does not" believe Stormy Daniels was threatened** and that "there is nothing to corroborate her claim," according to White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah. "The president doesn't believe any of the claims Ms. Daniels made in the interview last night were accurate." ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/white-house-denies-daniels-account-of-trump-affair-and-threats) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/26/trump-stormy-daniels-threat-485284))

* **The attorney for Stormy Daniels said Trump hasn't tweeted about Daniels because he knows her allegations of an affair are true**. After 61 weeks in the White House and more than 2,900 tweets, Trump hasn't attacked two people on Twitter: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/26/stormy-daniels-trump-tweets-484749) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/trump-silent-stormy-daniels.html))

6/ **Stormy Daniels accused Michael Cohen of defaming her by implying that she lied about her affair with Trump**. "Just because something isn’t true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage," Cohen said in a mid-February statement. "I will always protect Mr. Trump." Daniels amended her existing lawsuit against Trump, adding Trump's personal attorney as a defendant in the case, and charging that the confidentiality agreement was illegal, because Trump never signed it. The new complaint also says Cohen's $130,000 payment exceeded federal campaign contribution laws and was never reported. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/stormy-daniels-accuses-trump-attorney-of-defamation/2018/03/26/36da4122-30e4-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/26/stormy-daniels-trump-defamation-486100))

7/ **A government watchdog group accused Cambridge Analytica of violating federal election laws** in a pair of legal complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice. The laws prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica sent dozens of non-U.S. citizens to provide campaign strategy and messaging advice to Republican candidates in 2014. The complaints were filed by Common Cause. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-cambridge-analytica-accused-violating-us-election-laws/story?id=54010145) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-cambridge-analytica-workers-say-firm-sent-foreigners-to-advise-us-campaigns/2018/03/25/6a0d7d90-2fa2-11e8-911f-ca7f68bff0fc_story.html))

* **A government watchdog group has filed 30 ethics complaints with the White House and various federal agencies** alleging that employees are working in violation of Trump's executive order intended to "drain the swamp" and keep the government free of former lobbyists. Public Citizen identified 36 lobbyists who'd been tapped for government jobs dealing with issues they'd lobbied on, and only six of those appointees have received waivers since then. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/blizzard-ethics-complaints-filed-against-trump-administration-public-citizen-n859246))

8/ **The Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it's opened a non-public investigation into Facebook for its user privacy practices**. Shares of Facebook fell as much as 6% after the FTC announced it is investigating the company's data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica leak of 50 million users' information. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/facebook-under-federal-investigation-ftc-2926ae98-77fd-4c28-8ece-b0a51f95ca76.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/ftc-confirms-facebook-data-breach-investigation.html))

 3. **Andrew McCabe: "Not in my worst nightmares did I ever dream my FBI career would end this way."** ... Trump's cruelty reminded me of the days immediately following the firing of James B. Comey, as the White House desperately tried to push the falsehood that people in the FBI were celebrating the loss of our director. The president’s comments about me were equally hurtful and false, which shows that he has no idea how FBI people feel about their leaders. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/andrew-mccabe-not-in-my-worst-nightmares-did-i-dream-my-fbi-career-would-end-this-way/2018/03/23/5ff8fd8c-2eb9-11e8-8688-e053ba58f1e4_story.html))

 8. **Hundreds of thousands of people joined the Parkland survivors in Washington to "March for Our Lives" while Trump spent the day at the Trump International Golf Club**. The White House released a statement saying "We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today."

([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/25/politics/rick-santorum-guns-cnntv/index.html))
