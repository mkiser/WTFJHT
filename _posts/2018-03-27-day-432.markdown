1/ **The 2020 census will ask respondents if they are United States citizens, despite concerns from the Census Bureau**. Inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond, resulting in an undercount of the population, which would affect government agencies and groups that rely on the census data. The effects could also affect redistricting of the House and state legislatures over the next decade. It's been 70 years since the government has included a question about citizenship on the census.

* **Why putting a citizenship question on the census is a big deal**. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/census-citizenship-question-explainer/index.html))

2/ **California has sued the Trump administration, arguing that the question about citizenship in the 2020 Census violates the U.S. Constitution**. The Constitution requires a census every 10 years to count the "number of free persons" in each state. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra alleges the change violates the constitutional requirement of "actual Enumeration" of every person in every state, every 10 years, and that "California simply has too much to lose for us to allow the Trump Administration to botch this important decennial obligation." New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he would lead a multi-state lawsuit, which Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said she would join.

3/ **Trump has privately suggested that the US military could pay for the construction of his border wall**. Trump told advisers and discussed the idea in a private meeting last week with House Speaker Paul Ryan, saying the Pentagon could fund his wall by citing a "national security" risk. The latest reports echo Trump's tweet last week: "Build a WALL through M!" ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-privately-presses-for-military-to-pay-for-border-wall/2018/03/27/d79907a2-31c9-11e8-9759-56e51591e250_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/donald-trump-border-wall-military/index.html))

5/ **Trump has been telling some of his advisers that he hopes Rob Porter will return to the West Wing.** Porter stepped down after allegations surfaced that he had abused both of his ex-wives, but Trump has stayed in touch with Porter since his departure.
