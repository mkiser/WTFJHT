1/ **Trump invited Putin to the White House**, according to Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov. "When our presidents spoke on the phone, Trump suggested having the meeting in Washington at the White House," Ushakov said. "This is quite an interesting, positive idea."  During a March 20 phone call, Trump congratulated Putin for his reelection victory and discussed a possible meeting. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that "a number of potential venues, including the White House," were discussed during the phone call.

2/ **Trump tweeted that "DACA is dead" and there would be no "NO MORE DACA DEAL"** while pressing Congress to "immediately pass border legislation" because "our country is being stolen!"

Trump ended DACA in September.

4/ **Trump tweet-defended Sinclair's "fake news" promotional campaign**, which alleges "irresponsible, one-sided news stories" by mainstream media. "So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased," Trump tweeted. "Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke."

The Post is owned by Bezos. However, the Post and Amazon are two separate entities.
