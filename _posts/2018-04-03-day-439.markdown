1/ **Rod Rosenstein authorized Robert Mueller to investigate Paul Manafort for alleged "colluding with Russian government officials"** in a classified August 2017 memo. Mueller was given authority to also probe Manafort's work for the Ukrainian government. The memo was disclosed in a court filing as Mueller's prosecutors seek to counter arguments by Manafort's lawyers that his indictment should be thrown out.

2/ **Alex van der Zwaan is the first person sentenced in Robert Mueller's investigation**. The Dutch attorney, who admitted to lying to federal agents about his work in Ukraine with Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, was sent to prison for 30 days.

3/ **Mueller's investigation is asking about a private consulting firm working with the United Arab Emirates**. Mueller's team is asking about Wikistrat's business relationship with George Nader, a Lebanese-American who serves as a top adviser to U.A.E. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and was also close to the Trump administration last year. Wikistrat was contracted by the U.A.E. beginning in 2015 to conduct war game scenarios on Islamist political movements in Yemen.

4/ **The EPA will revoke an Obama-era standard requiring cars to average more than 50 mpg by 2025**. "The Obama Administration's determination was wrong," Scott Pruitt said, adding that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will establish a new standard that "allows auto manufacturers to make cars that people both want and can afford." The EPA will also "reexamine" a waiver that allows California to set stricter standards than those mandated by the federal government.

5/ **Scott Pruitt bypassed the White House in order to give substantial pay raises for two of his closest aides**. After the Presidential Personnel Office rejected Pruitt's raise request, the EPA administrator reappointed the aides using an obscure provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act. The move gave Pruitt total control over their contracts to grant the raises on his own. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/pruitt-epa/557123/))

6/ **The EPA approved a pipeline-expansion project last year while Scott Pruitt was renting a $50-a-night condo linked to the company's lobbying firm**. The expansion of the Alberta Clipper pipeline, an Enbridge Inc. project, would allow for hundreds of thousands more barrels of oil a day to flow through this pipeline to the U.S. from Canada's tar sands. At the time, Pruitt was living in the condo owned in part by Vicki Hart, the wife of J. Steven Hart, the chairman of Enbridge. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/climate/epa-pruitt-pipeline-apartment.html))

7/ **Trump called Pruitt to say "we've got your back,"** urging him to "keep his head up" and "keep fighting." John Kelly reiterated those sentiments in a call to Pruitt Tuesday morning. According to a senior administration official, Kelly has considered firing Pruitt, but is waiting for the outcome of an EPA inspector general's report into Pruitt's travels expenses.
