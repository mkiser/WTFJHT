1/ **The Supreme Court ruled that a law subjecting immigrants to deportation for some "crimes of violence" is unconstitutionally vague**. Justice Neil Gorsuch – Trump's pick for the Supreme Court – joined with the court's liberal justices, providing the swing vote for the first time in a 5-4 ruling that invalidated the federal statute.

2/ **The Senate will not take up legislation limiting Trump's ability to fire Robert Mueller**. "I'm the one who decides what we take to the floor," Mitch McConnell said, "that's my responsibility as the majority leader and we will not be having this on the floor of the Senate." McConnell's statement comes about a week after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said his panel would take up and vote on the measure during a meeting on April 26. A handful of House Republicans have also endorsed legislation that would protect the special counsel.

3/ **Trump rejected a new round of sanctions that would have been imposed against Russia on Monday**. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that "a decision will be made in the near future," and Trump has now decided to not move forward with the sanctions. She added that Trump "has been clear that he's going to be tough on Russia, but at the same time he'd still like to have a good relationship with them." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/us/politics/trump-rejects-sanctions-russia-syria.html))

4/ **Trump's National Economic Council chairman said Nikki Haley "got ahead" of herself** in announcing new sanctions on Russia. Larry Kudlow insisted there was no confusion within the administration about the sanctions. Trump signed off on the sanctions package, but changed his mind following the airstrikes in Syria. "Russia sanctions were a part of the agreed-upon plan going into the strike and going into the weekend," said a senior administration official. "As recently as Saturday that was reconfirmed as part of the plan."

6/ **Fox News pledged "full support" of Sean Hannity after it was revealed that he had an "informal relationship" with Michael Cohen**. In a statement, the network said it "was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday."

* **Sean Hannity has been represented by two other Trump-connected lawyers: Victoria Toensing and Jay Sekulow**. The duo, acting as "Counsel for Sean Hannity," once sent a cease-and-desist letter to a radio station based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Sekulow is Trump's personal attorney working full-time on the response to Robert Mueller's inquiry. He recently announced he was hiring Toensing to join him, but reversed course due to unspecified conflicts.

7/ **The Trump campaign paid $66,000 to Keith Schiller's lawyer**, Trump's former longtime bodyguard.

Schiller testified to the House Intelligence Committee in November that someone made an offer to send five women to Trump's hotel room in Moscow during to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. Schiller said he turned down the offer on Trump's behalf and that no women ever came, as far as he was aware. Federal election law allows the use of campaign money for legal fees, but only if the fees are related to a matter connected to the campaign.

12/ **North and South Korea are reportedly set to announce an official end to their 68-year war**. Pyongyang and Seoul have technically been at war since the 1950-1953 Korean conflict ended with a truce – and not a peace treaty. While meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the two Koreas "have my blessing to discuss the end of the war."
