1/ **Defense Secretary James Mattis wanted to get Congressional approval before bombing Syria last week. Trump overruled him**  because he wanted his tweets to be supported by action, despite warnings that an overly aggressive strike could spark a larger dispute with Russia. A limited airstrike on three targets was the compromise. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/politics/jim-mattis-trump-syria-attack.html))

2/ **Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un over Easter weekend for a top-secret visit** to lay the groundwork for direct talks between Trump and the North Korean leader. Pompeo was nominated as secretary of state shortly after the meeting. Trump is expected to meet with Kim by June. While meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Trump said his administration has "had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels with North Korea." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-china-trade-dispute-looms-over-trump-summit-with-japans-abe/2018/04/17/2c94cb02-424f-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?utm_term=.d3892562bdff) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/world/asia/trump-japan-north-korea-summit-talks.html))

3/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders said "the administration does not comment on the CIA director's travel."** Hours later, Trump tweeted that "Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week.

4/ **Two Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote against Mike Pompeo**, Trump's nominee for secretary of state.

([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pompeo/pompeo-nomination-runs-into-more-u-s-senate-democrat-opposition-idUSKBN1HP1WD) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/mike-pompeo-committee-democrats/index.html))

5/ **Nikki Haley: "I don't get confused."** The comment by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations comes in response to a White House official attributing her statement that Trump would impose sanctions on Russia to "momentary confusion." Larry Kudlow, the president's national economics adviser, said Haley "got ahead of the curve." Later, Kudlow called Haley to apologize, saying "she was certainly not confused." He added: "She was basically following what she thought was policy. The policy was changed and she wasn't told about it, so she was in a box." The White House sent out a document – titled "White House talking points" – to surrogates on Saturday letting them know that Trump had decided to take punitive action against Moscow.

In May 2017, Trump [told](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/12/Day-113/#6-trump-shifts-his-reason-for-firing) NBC's Lester Holt that his decision to fire Comey was "this Russia thing," which he called "a made up story" and "an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won." Today, Trump tweeted that "Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation," adding the requisite all-caps "NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!" ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/trump-comey-russia-investigation/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/18/trumps-tweet-on-firing-comey-is-thoroughly-debunked-by-donald-trump/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-tweet-comey-firing-russia-investigation-lester-holt-7d2603b3-6cd8-4cea-94e8-6054fbe15ab8.html))

7/ **Trump dismissed the sketch of the person that Stormy Daniels claims threatened her years ago on Trump's behalf**, calling the person a "nonexistent man" and said the sketch was a "total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!"

David Pecker, American Media's chairman, is friends with Trump. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/us/politics/karen-mcdougal-american-media-settlement.html))

9/ **Trump is still "apoplectic" about the FBI raids on Michael Cohen's hotel room, office and home**, a source close to the president said.

([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-comey-north-korea-japan/index.html))
