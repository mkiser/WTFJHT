1/ **Flight records contradict Trump's claim he never spent the night in Moscow during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant**. According to James Comey's memos, Trump twice told the now-former FBI director that there is no way the "golden showers thing" happened because he claims he arrived on the morning of the event and left shortly after it ended in the early hours of the next morning. Christopher Steele's dossier alleges that Trump had prostitutes perform "golden showers" on the bed in the Ritz-Carlton's presidential suite in 2013 during the Miss Universe pageant. Flights records show Trump arrived in Moscow on November 8th, 2013, and left at 3:58am on November 10th, 2013.

* **Trump's false claims to Comey about Moscow stay could aid Mueller**. James Comey says the president told him that he never spent the night in Moscow in 2013, but flight records, social media and his bodyguard's testimony show otherwise.

* **Trump flew to Moscow on November 7th, 2013**, landing Friday, November 8th.

* **The next day, Trump was at the Ritz-Carlton hotel**, did a tour of Moscow, and attended the Miss Universe pageant, followed by an afterparty that started at 1am.

* **Keith Schiller, Trump's bodyguard, [testified](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-bodyguard-testifies-russian-offered-trump-women-was-turned-down-n819386) before Congress that "a Russian participant" offered to send five women to Trump's hotel room on November 9th**. Schiller reportedly rejected the offer and stood outside Trump's hotel room until he went to bed for the night.

* **The jet Trump took to Moscow left at 3:58am on the night of November 9th, 2013**, landing in New Jersey at 4:11am local time.

2/ **Trump's new national security adviser chaired a nonprofit that promoted misleading and anti-Muslim news**. Bolton was chairman of the Gatestone Institute from 2013 until last month. The advocacy group claims that a "jihadist takeover" of Europe is leading to a "Great White Death," which was amplified by a Russian troll factory that sought to portray Western society as at risk of "Islamization." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/john-bolton-chaired-anti-muslim-think-tank-n868171))

3/ **The Trump administration is challenging Native Americans' exemption from new Medicaid work rules because it would be illegal preferential treatment**. Meaning Native Americans would need to get a job if they want to keep their health care in states that institute work requirements for Medicaid. The administration has allowed three states – Arkansas, Kentucky and Indiana – to begin instituting such requirements, and at least 10 other states have submitted or are preparing applications.

4/ **The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted in favor of Mike Pompeo's nomination for secretary of state**, after Rand Paul flipped from opposing to supporting. The committee approved Pompeo by an 11-to-10 vote along party lines and is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate later this week. Earlier, Trump tweeted that it's "hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State," claiming Democrats "will not approve hundreds of good people" by "maxing out" the confirmation process. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/23/paul-to-back-pompeo-ensuring-confirmation-as-secretary-of-state-546037) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pompeo/senate-panel-backs-pompeo-as-secretary-of-state-idUSKBN1HU26X) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/us/politics/mike-pompeo-rand-paul-secretary-of-state-foreign-relations-committee.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/critical-week-mike-pompeo-rocky-path-senate-confirmation-n867891))

5/ **Trump rejected speculation that Michael Cohen will flip**, tweeting that he has "always liked and respected" his attorney. He added that "Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!" In a flurry of weekend tweets, Trump called New York Times journalist [Maggie Haberman](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/) a "third rate reporter" and a Clinton "flunkie" following her [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen.html) that Cohen could end up cooperating with federal officials as legal fees and possible criminal charges pile up.

* **Hillary Clinton: The First Amendment is "under open assault" in the Trump era**. "We are living through an all-out war on truth, facts and reason," Clinton said. "When leaders deny things we can see with our own eyes, like the size of a crowd at the inauguration, when they refuse to accept settled science when it comes to urgent challenges like climate change ... it is the beginning of the end of freedom, and that is not hyperbole. It’s what authoritarian regimes through history have done." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/clinton-free-press-is-under-open-assault-in-trump-era/2018/04/23/73ab9d7e-4707-11e8-8082-105a446d19b8_story.html))

6/ **The former lawyer for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal is cooperating with investigators in the Michael Cohen probe**. Keith Davidson provided the Southern District of New York with "certain limited electronic information" about the confidentiality agreements he negotiated between Cohen and the two women regarding their alleged affairs with Trump. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/politics/keith-davidson-michael-cohen/index.html))

* **Stormy Daniels is telling the truth that somebody threatened her to stay silent about her affair with Trump**, according to her friend and fellow porn star. Jessica Drake is named in the nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed as somebody with whom she discussed her alleged affair with Trump. Drake claims she refused a $10,000 offer to have sex with Trump after meeting him during a Lake Tahoe golf event in 2006. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/porn-star-stormy-daniels-telling-truth-alleged-trump/story?id=54651663))

7/ **Kellyanne Conway accused CNN of sexism for asking about her husband's critical Trump tweets**. Conway said the question by CNN's Dana Bash "was meant to harass and embarrass," which was inappropriate and created a "double standard." Conway's husband, George Conway, has been tweeting and retweeting critical comments about Trump, but deleted a handful of tweets last month. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/384319-conway-lashes-out-at-cnn-for-question-about-husbands-tweets) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/22/kellyanne-conway-dana-bash-cnn-545220) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-george-conway-tweets-cnntv/index.html))

8/ **During Barbara Bush's funeral, Trump tweeted about the DNC's lawsuit over hacked emails**, accused James Comey of leaking classified memos, and called Jeff Sessions "Mr. Magoo" and Rod Rosenstein "Mr. Peepers." Melania Trump, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama, meanwhile, attended the service. On MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Mika Brzezinski called Trump's tweets "especially insulting to the United States of America" on a day "the world said goodbye to Barbara Bush." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/384403-morning-joe-host-trump-tweeting-during-barbara-bush-funeral-was-insulting-to))

9/ **Trump's legislative affairs director won't rule out Trump firing Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein**, saying the special counsel has moved outside his original mandate. Marc Short said: "We believe the scope has gone well beyond what was intended to be Russian meddling in the election," adding, "We don't know how far off the investigation is going to veer." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/22/mueller-trump-marc-short-firing-545181))

poll/ **59% of registered voters believe that Trump does not deserve to be re-elected**. 37% of voters say Trump deserves re-election, which is on par with Clinton (38%) and Obama (37%) who had similar figures at the time of the 1994 and 2010 midterm elections, respectively.
