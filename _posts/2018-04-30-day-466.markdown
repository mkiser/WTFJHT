1/ **Michael Avenatti: Trump is in "panic mode" and expects Michael Cohen to cooperate with investigators**. "We're going to be able to prove that the president knew about the agreement," Stormy Daniels' attorney said, "and knew about the $130,000." Trump has denied a relationship with Daniels or knowledge of the payment to her, but told Fox and Friends that Cohen was representing him in the "crazy Stormy Daniels deal" – contradicting what he said on Air Force One.

2/ **The Trump campaign spent nearly $228,000 to pay for part of Michael Cohen's legal fees**. Federal Election Commission records show three "legal consulting" payments made from the Trump campaign to a firm representing Cohen between October 2017 and January 2018. Cohen did not have a formal role in the Trump campaign and it's illegal to spend campaign funds for personal use.

3/ **A federal judge granted a 90-day delay in Stormy Daniels' suit against Trump, saying it appeared "likely" that Michael Cohen would be indicted in a related criminal investigation**. The judge called Cohen "the alleged mastermind" of the deal, which makes his testimony "indispensable." Cohen plans to assert his Fifth Amendment rights if asked to answer any further questions about Daniels' suit, which seeks to void an agreement that led to a $130,000 payment Cohen facilitated before the 2016 presidential election.

4/ **Stormy Daniels filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump for his "total con job" tweet about the forensic sketch of a man who allegedly threatened her in 2011**. The filing says the tweet was "false and defamatory," arguing that Trump was speaking about Daniels and that he "knew that his false, disparaging statement would be read by people around the world, as well as widely reported."

5/ **Trump threatened to shut down the federal government in September if Congress doesn't agree to include more funding for his border wall in the next spending bill**. "We come up again on September 28th," Trump said during a rally in Michigan on Saturday, "and if we don't get border security we will have no choice, we will close down the country because we need border security." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-government/trump-threatens-govt-shutdown-in-sept-if-no-funding-for-wall-idUSKBN1I0018))

6/ **John Kelly referred to Trump as "an idiot,"** according to four officials who heard the comments. Some current and former White House officials expect Kelly to leave by July – his one-year mark. Trump fired Rex Tillerson for calling him a "moron" in front of colleagues. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kelly-thinks-he-s-saving-u-s-disaster-calls-trump-n868961))

7/ **Ronny Jackson will not return to his former job as the president's personal physician**. A series of allegations caused Jackson to withdraw from consideration to become the next secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sean Conley took over for Jackson last month and will continue in that role. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/29/ronny-jackson-trump-doctor-559529) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ronny-jackson-wont-return-to-job-as-trumps-physician/2018/04/29/101d2bfe-4c0e-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?utm_term=.286b132fdde6))

8/ **Trump called on Montana Senator Jon Tester to resign and threatened to spread allegations about him in retaliation for releasing a document summarizing the allegations against Ronny Jackson**. Trump said the allegations against Jackson were fabricated. "Tester started throwing out things that he's heard," Trump told the crowd. "Well, I know things about Tester that I could say, too. And if I said them, he'd never be elected again." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/us/politics/trump-tester-jackson-va.html))

9/ **The Justice Department removed language from its manual related to gerrymandering, freedom of the press, and limits on prosecutorial power**. Jeff Sessions' tough-on-crime policies were added to the manual, as well as language that underscores his focus on religious liberty, and Trump's attempts to crack down on government leaks. The last significant update to the manual happened in 1997.

12/ **The FBI questioned a Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter linked to Putin, Trump, and Michael Cohen**. The FBI showed up unannounced at Fedor Emelianenko's hotel room in Chicago. "All I can say is that, yeah, they showed up unannounced, knocking on our doors," Emelianenko's manager Jerry Millen said. Trump announced a joint venture involving MMA and Emelianenko in 2008. Cohen was the project's chief operating officer.
