1/ **Robert Mueller has at least 49 questions he wants to ask Trump regarding his ties to Russia and alleged obstruction of justice**. The questions deal primarily with Trump's firing of James Comey and Michael Flynn, as well as his treatment of Jeff Sessions and the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Other topics of inquiry include Trump's conversations with Michael Cohen about a real estate deal in Moscow, Jared Kushner's attempts to set up a backchannel to Russia, contacts Trump had with Roger Stone, and Trump's 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant.

2/ **Trump tweeted that it was "So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were 'leaked' to the media."** The leak didn't come from Mueller's office, but were provided to the New York Times by a person outside of Trump's legal team. "No questions on Collusion," Trump added. "Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!" The list includes 13 questions related to possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump followed up with another tweet 45 minutes later: "It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!"([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/so-disgraceful-trump-lashes-out-at-publication-of-special-counsel-questions/2018/05/01/f3796a9e-4c7b-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/01/trump-new-york-times-mueller-561692))

3/ **A former Mueller assistant believes Trump was the source of the leaked questions**. "Lawyers wouldn't write questions this way, in my estimation," said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former assistant to Robert Mueller. "Some of the grammar is not even proper," he continued. "I think these are more notes that the White House has taken and then they have expanded upon the conversation to write out these as questions." Zeldin worked with Mueller in the early 1990s.

* **Nixon's White House counsel said that if the Trump administration leaked Mueller's questions it could qualify as obstruction of justice**. John Dean said leaking the questions could be an attempt to "try to disrupt the flow of information" or tip off a witness.

4/ **Trump allies in the House have drafted articles of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein**. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said the draft articles are "a last resort option, if the Department of Justice fails to respond" to his requests for more information. The draft articles are not expected to garner much support. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-allied-house-conservatives-draft-articles-of-impeachment-against-rosenstein-as-last-resort/2018/04/30/d78af412-4c97-11e8-b725-92c89fe3ca4c_story.html?utm_term=.3dae898bc378))

5/ **Rod Rosenstein to the House Freedom Caucus: "The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,"** adding "\[t\]hey can't even resist leaking their own drafts." A Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee said the Republican effort to impeach Rosenstein would send a "terrible message" and that "We should protect our democracy, protect this process, protect the rule of law." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/rod-rosenstein-fires-back-at-reports-of-impeachment-drafts-606c41ce-90dd-4c73-8058-bbc8ec21417b.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/david-cicilline-rod-rosenstein-impeachment-cnntv/index.html))

6/ **Trump's bodyguard and a Trump Organization lawyer took the original and only copy of Trump's medical chart from his doctor in February 2017** after Dr. Harold Bornstein told the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-prostate-drug-hair-harold-bornstein.html) that Trump takes Propecia. Keith Schiller, who was serving as director of Oval Office operations, also took lab reports under Trump's name as well as under the pseudonyms the office used for Trump. Bornstein said he was not given a form authorizing the release of the records, which is a violation of patient privacy law. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called taking possession of medical records "standard operating procedure for a new president." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-doc-says-trump-bodyguard-lawyer-raided-his-office-took-n870351))

* **The White House pushed back on claims that Dr. Ronny Jackson is no longer Trump's personal physician**, despite reports that Jackson will not return to his previous role as physician to the president now that he has withdrawn his nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/385474-white-house-pushes-back-on-reports-of-jacksons-ouster-as-trumps))

7/ **Mike Pence's physician privately warned the White House in September that Ronny Jackson may have violated the federal privacy protections of Karen Pence and intimidated the vice president's doctor**. The previously unreported incident is the first sign that the White House knew about Jackson's misconduct months before Trump and his staff defended Jackson's professionalism and insisted that he had been thoroughly vetted. The incident is also the first allegation of medical misconduct by Jackson, adding to a long line of other allegations against the former White House physician.
