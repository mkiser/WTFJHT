1/ **Robert Mueller warned Trump's legal team that he could subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if he refuses to speak to federal investigators** involved in the Russia probe. Mueller raised the possibility of a subpoena during a tense meeting in March after Trump's attorneys insisted that Trump was under no obligation to speak with investigators. Unlike an interview with the special counsel, Trump would not be allowed to bring his lawyers to a grand jury hearing. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-raised-possibility-of-presidential-subpoena-in-meeting-with-trumps-legal-team/2018/05/01/2bdec08e-4d51-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html?utm_term=.37a657b7e0c9))

2/ **Trump's current legal team lacks the security clearances required to discuss sensitive issues during a presidential sit-down with Mueller**. Trump's former attorney John Dowd was the only person on Trump's legal team with the proper clearance – he resigned in March. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/trump-lawyers-said-to-lack-security-clearance-amid-mueller-talks))

3/ **Trump plans to add Bill Clinton's impeachment lawyer to his legal team** and replace Ty Cobb, who will leave at the end of May. Cobb has been the lead lawyer representing Trump in the special counsel investigation. Emmet Flood is expected to take a more adversarial approach to the Mueller investigation than Cobb. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/emmet-flood-ty-cobb-white-house-lawyer-special-counsel.html))

4/ **Ty Cobb said a Trump interview with Mueller is "certainly not off the table."** Rudy Giuliani added Trump's legal team was still "several weeks away" from determining whether Trump would sit for an interview with Mueller.  He also said that the White House needs to be "more aggressive" with the special counsel, saying that a potential interview would be "max, two to three hours around a narrow set of questions." Cobb added that he has "no doubt" Mueller didn't leak the list of 49 questions for Trump.

5/ **Trump threatened to "get involved" in the "rigged system" over the Justice Department's ongoing dispute with the House Freedom Caucus** about a memo outlining the topics being investigated by Robert Mueller. "There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax)," Trump tweeted, "and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup and trap)."

6/ **Trump dictated his 2015 glowing letter of health**, his personal physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, claimed. "He dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter," Bornstein said. "I just made it up as I went along." The letter claimed, among other things, that Trump's "physical strength and stamina are extraordinary" and "If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/harold-bornstein-trump-letter/index.html))

7/ **Cambridge Analytica is shutting down and will file for bankruptcy** following mounting legal fees in the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica's CEO called the current environment "futile" due to the company's damaged reputation and a loss of clients from the ongoing investigations into the company's data harvesting scandal that compromised the information of up to 87 million people.

### Notables.

1. **Mueller's office wants to wait two more months before sentencing Michael Flynn**, who is cooperating with the special counsel after pleading guilty to lying to investigators. "Due to the status of the special counsel's investigation," Mueller's team told the court, "the parties do not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/michael-flynn-sentencing/index.html))

2. **Ukraine stopped cooperating with Mueller regarding Paul Manafort at the same time the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country anti-tank missiles**. Ukrainian law enforcement also allowed Konstantin Kilimnika, a potential witness to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, to leave for Russia, putting him out of reach for questioning. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-mueller-manafort-missiles.html))

3. **Iowa lawmakers passed the nation's most restrictive abortion legislation**, which would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected – before some women even know they're pregnant.

([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/heartbeat-bill-iowa-lawmakers-pass-most-restrictive-abortion-legislation-n870686))

4. **Planned Parenthood and two other reproductive rights groups are suing the Trump administration to block a "radical shift" in the federal Title X program**.

6. **Trump has asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause**, which bars officials from accepting gifts or other payments from foreign governments without congressional approval.

([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-emoluments/trump-claims-immunity-asks-court-to-toss-foreign-payments-suit-idUSKBN1I31Y6) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit/index.html))

7. **Pence called Joe Arpaio a champion of "the rule of law."** Trump pardoned Arpaio last year after his contempt of court conviction for ignoring a federal judge's order to stop detaining people because he merely suspected them of being undocumented immigrants. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-champion-of-the-rule-of-law-pence-praises-pardoned-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2018/05/02/b8ae812c-4e0d-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html))
