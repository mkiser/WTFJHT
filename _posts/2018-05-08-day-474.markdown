1/ **Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal**, reinstating all sanctions it had waived and imposing additional economic penalties. Trump's aides persuaded him twice last year not to withdraw. Trump called the accord "a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made," adding that the 2015 pact was "a great embarrassment." Following Trumpâ€™s announcement, Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement expressing "regret and concern" while pledging their "continuing commitment" to the terms of the agreement. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-will-announce-plans-to-pull-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-pleas-from-european-leaders/2018/05/08/4c148252-52ca-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html))

2/ **Trump is frustrated with Rudy Giuliani's inability to handle the Stormy Daniels situation** and is concerned that Giuliani's media appearances are raising more questions than they are answering. Some aides say they expect Trump to fire Giuliani if he is unable to turn things around. Trump recently told a confidant that perhaps Giuliani should "be benched" from TV appearances temporarily if he can't stay on message. Giuliani, however, said that Trump "is encouraging me to do more of them. I try to keep them under control," adding that Trump is "very comfortable" with the strategy.

3/ **Robert Mueller rejected Trump's request to answer questions from investigators in writing**. Trump's legal team had been pushing for Mueller to allow him to submit written answers, because they're afraid that Trump might lie to or mislead investigators during an in-person interview. Giuliani said he would fight a potential subpoena for Trump to testify in front of a grand jury, but has stopped short of saying that Trump would ignore a subpoena from the special counsel.

4/ **Trump's lawyers hope to decide by May 17 whether he will testify**. May 17 is the one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump's lawyers contend that testifying would be a distraction from his work as president. However, in an informal, four-hour practice session, Trump was only able to walk through two questions. "Anyone can see he has great difficulty staying on a subject," one person familiar with the legal team's deliberations said.

5/ **The shell company Michael Cohen used to pay Stormy Daniels received more than $1 million in payments from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch** and Fortune 500 companies with business before the Trump administration. At least $4.4 million flowed through the shell company Cohen used, Essential Consultants, starting shortly before Trump was elected president and continuing to this January. Essential Consultants received about $500,000 from Columbus Nova, an investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch.

6/ **Mueller's investigators questioned a Russian oligarch about $500,000 in payments made to Michael Cohen after the election**.  Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, alleges that Cohen received about $500,000 from Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin who was placed on a list of sanctioned Russians related to election interference. According to a [dossier published](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pskgpwr15r48tx5/Executive%20Summary.pdf?dl=0) by Avenatti, "Vekselberg and his cousin Mr. Andrew Intrater routed eight payments to Mr. Cohen through a company named Columbus Nova LLC beginning in January 2017 and continuing until at least August 2017." Vekselberg is also one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/08/russia-probe-prison-mueller-zwaan-574609))

7/ **Senior White House staff are urging Trump to fire EPA chief Scott Pruitt**, who is currently the subject of 11 federal investigations. Some Republicans are also calling for Pruitt's resignation. Trump has championed Pruitt up to this point, but support from the president appears to be waning as Pruitt's legal and ethical issues continue to pile up. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/climate/trump-fire-pruitt-epa.html))
