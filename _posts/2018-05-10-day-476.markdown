1/ **Mike Pence: It's time for Robert Mueller to "wrap it up" because it's "been about a year since this investigation began."** He added that the Trump administration has "fully cooperated" with the probe, which Trump has frequently referred to as a "witch hunt." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-says-its-time-for-special-counsel-to-wrap-up-russia-investigation/2018/05/10/88e17d4e-544a-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/2c48454c665c4f43bfabaf13a495d660) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/mike-pence-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html))

2/ **Rudy Giuliani: Trump "wasn't aware" that Michael Cohen pitched his access to the President to potential clients** following the 2016 election in order to land consulting deals. "I talked to the President only one time about this and that was the first day it came out and he wasn't aware of that situation," Giuliani said. AT&T and Novartis were among the companies that hired Cohen's consulting firm, Essential Consultants, for "insights" about how the Trump administration would approach certain policy matters.

3/ **The Russia-linked company that hired Michael Cohen registered a number of alt-right websites during the 2016 elections**. Columbus Nova is listed as the registrant behind a handful of website domains named after the alt-right movement, including Alt-right.co, Alternate-right.com, Alternate-rt.com, Alt-rite.com, and others. The brother of Andrew Intrater, Columbus Nova's U.S. CEO, is named in the registration databases for the websites. Columbus Nova said Frederick Intrater was not acting on behalf of the company, even though he had used his work email address and listed the organization. Columbus Nova gave $500,000 to Cohen in the first half of 2017.

4/ **Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released 3,500 Facebook ads purchased by a Russian troll farm** from mid-2015 to mid-2017. The ads, from the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, reached at least 146 million people on Facebook and Instagram, spreading inflammatory and divisive messages on immigration, race, gun control, Islam, LGBT-centric topics, and more, in an attempt to polarize Americans. Facebook's targeting tools allowed the Russian agents to deliver their disinformation to groups of users according to their location, age, gender, and interests.

Schiff [said in a statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/10/here-are-the-3400-facebook-ads-purchased-by-russias-online-trolls-during-the-2016-election/). "The only way we can begin to inoculate ourselves against a future attack is to see first-hand the types of messages, themes and imagery the Russians used to divide us."

5/ **National security adviser John Bolton wants to eliminate the top White House cybersecurity job.** Bolton and his team are leading an effort to abolish the role of special assistant to the president and cybersecurity coordinator.

6/ **John McCain gave the Steele dossier to then-FBI director James Comey**. "I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as 'the dossier,'" McCain writes in his [new book](https://amzn.to/2rwalbK). "I reviewed its contents. The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation's security should have done." McCain concludes: "I did what duty demanded I do."

7/ **Trump's pick to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, claimed during her Senate confirmation hearing that the CIA "never did" interrogations "historically."** The claim is demonstrably false, but CIA spokesman Dean Boyd came to Haspel's defense, saying Haspel meant that the CIA "did not have ... a detention and interrogation program" before 9/11. Senators were visibly frustrated with Haspel's refusal to answer questions about whether she believes torture is immoral. McCain called on the Senate to reject Haspel's nomination, citing her refusal to acknowledge "torture's immorality." ([Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-cia-pick-haspel-nominee-torture-911-waterboarding-918423) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/john-mccain-gina-haspel-cia/index.html))

* **Dick Cheney called on the CIA to restart its controversial "enhanced" interrogation program** used during the George W. Bush administration.

* **A Fox News military commentator argued that torture is good because "it worked on John \[McCain\]**. That's why they call him 'Songbird John.'"
