1/ **Michael Cohen's business partner took a plea deal that requires him to cooperate with the government as a potential witness in state and federal investigations**. Evgeny Freidman is a Russian immigrant known as the "Taxi King," and he specifically agreed to assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, according to a person briefed on the matter. Freidman was disbarred earlier this month, has been accused of failing to pay $5 million in taxes, and is facing multiple counts of criminal tax fraud and one of grand larceny. Freidman's cooperation is seen as potential leverage to pressure Cohen into working with Mueller's team on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.

2/ **Scott Pruitt spent at least $9,600 on decorations and furniture for his personal office**. Pruitt bought Smithsonian artwork, a refurbished desk, and other framed items. He paid the Smithsonian Institution $1,950 in labor and delivery charges to rent out three art pieces for his executive suite, and spent more than $2,500 on frames for various items, including a photo of himself with Trump and an American flag. The internal document with the list of expenditures also confirmed earlier reports that Pruitt spent $2,963 on a standing "captain's" desk and $2,075 on a different desk. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/388895-pruitt-spent-at-least-9600-on-office-decor-restored-desks-email))

* **Earlier reporting (March 14): Scott Pruitt’s $25,000 soundproof phone booth? It actually cost around $43,000.** "In addition to the soundproof booth, invoices released by the EPA show Pruitt paid $2,075 to refinish a desk that had been stored in a government warehouse, as well as $2,963 for a new 'captain’s desk' in his office." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/03/14/scott-pruitts-25000-soundproof-phone-booth-it-actually-cost-more-like-43000/?utm_term=.2ed8399c4d9a))

3/ **The White House did not invite Democrats to a private briefing on the FBI informant involved in the investigation into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians** during and after the 2016 election. Two senior House Republicans were invited to the briefing, which was coordinated by John Kelly and will be held on Thursday. Democrats are demanding that Democratic lawmakers be included in the briefing. Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said Democrats weren't invited because they didn't specifically ask for details about the informant. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/22/fbi-informant-meeting-doj-gop-democrats-white-house-603275))

* **Donald Trump turned a rumor into a full-blown government conspiracy in just 5 days.** Trump went from having heard a rumor about the FBI's use of a confidential source to ckaiming that it was an intentional and political attempt to install a "spy" within his ranks on behalf of Obama's Justice Department. ([Politico](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/donald-trump-spygate/index.html))

* **Trump’s FBI spy theory is completely insane.** "The spy theory holds that the FBI, working on orders from the Obama administration, implanted a spy into the Trump campaign in order to help Hillary Clinton’s campaign. . . . This does not explain why the FBI failed to announce either the results of its spying campaign, or even the existence of the investigation, in time to help Clinton win, rather than allowing the probe to remain secret until well after the election." ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/trumps-fbi-russia-scandal-spy-theory-mueller-insane.html))

4/ **Trump said he constantly bashes the press  in order to "demean" and "discredit" journalists so the public won't believe "negative stories" about him**. Lesley Stahl says she asked Trump, "Why are you doing it over and over?" She continued: "And he said: 'You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.'" ([Yahoo!

5/ **Mike Pompeo says the U.S. will fight back against what he called "continued efforts" by Russia to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections**. Pompeo did not provide any details as to what the "appropriate measures" would entail, but he said the U.S. has so far been unable to establish "effective deterrence" to halt Russia's efforts. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/8e511489492b4e0f8b8918c7354d26e4))

6/ **John Kelly signed off on a plan to fire a handful of mid-level and junior aides after Trump demanded changes to the White House communications team** in order to limit the leaks coming out of his administration. The plan would remove some of the department's low-level employees, while keeping high-level staffers such as Sarah Huckabee-Sanders and other officials on board. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/22/trump-communications-team-changes-603417))

7/ **Jared Kushner’s prison reform plan passed** **in the House of Representatives**. The bipartisan "First Step Act," which has Trump's support, passed with a 360-59 vote. The bill would provide training programs for prisoners and would be the first major bipartisan success for the Trump administration. Mitch McConnell, however, has indicated that he is unlikely to bring up the bill in the Senate unless Republicans can find a way to resolve their differences. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/22/house-easily-passes-prison-reform-bill-backed-by-white-house-603333))

* **Congress’s prison reform bill, explained:** The First Step Act has Trump’s support — but faces some Democratic opposition. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/22/17377324/first-step-act-prison-reform-congress))

* **Is the “First Step Act” real reform?** The bill addresses the dire need for rehabilitative services in the federal prison system, proves there is strong bipartisan support for at least modest criminal justice reform and underscores a strategic debate that has split the Democratic Party. ([The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/22/is-the-first-step-act-real-reform))

* **Trump-backed prison reform bill DOA in the Senate.** While Trump has shown interest in prison reform, fractures within the Republican party have left little room for a win when it comes to bringing any criminal justice bill to the Senate floor. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/trump-prison-reform-senate-601983))

8/ **A federal district court judge ruled that Trump can't block people on Twitter over their political views**. Judge Buchwald of the Southern District of New York said Trump's Twitter account is a public forum and blocking people based on their political opinions amounts to viewpoint discrimination and a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/regulation/389021-judge-rules-trump-cant-block-users-on-twitter)) 

poll/ **Thirty-six percent of voters say they would vote for Trump over a generic Democratic candidate in 2020**. Forty-four percent would choose the generic Democrat, and 20 percent of voters remain undecided. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/trump-democrats-2020-election-603421))
