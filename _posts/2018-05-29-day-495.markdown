1/ **The U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied immigrant children between October and December of 2017.** The acting assistant secretary of the Administration of Children and Families, Steven Wagner, claimed during testimony in April that the agency was not legally responsible for the children. "I understand that it has been \[the Department of Health and Human Service's\] long-standing interpretation of the law that ORR is not legally responsible for children after they are released from ORR care," Wagner said. The children are not lost, said Deputy HHS Secretary Eric Hargan, their sponsors "simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made." The comments come as the Trump administration have been defending the policy of separating immigrant children from their families as part of increased border enforcement efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border.

* **How federal authorities track undocumented minors.** "My experience both in the Obama administration and under prior administrations, both Republican and Democratic," said former head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under Obama, Bob Carey, "was that the law was not interpreted in the same way. And children were not being separated from their parents unless there was a very strong body of evidence that indicated that they were not their parents."

5/ **The Trump administration refused to acknowledge the findings of the scientific community when it comes to dealing with climate change**. An internal White House memo revealed the three options the administration is considering when it comes to dealing with federal climate science reports. They are: (1) consider "debating" the established climate science; (2) cast doubt on scientists' conclusions; and (3) simply ignore those conclusions. Accepting or acting on the conclusions, which are shared by at least 97 percent of scientists, is not an option that the administration is willing to consider.
