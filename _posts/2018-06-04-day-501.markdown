1/ **Trump dictated Trump Jr.'s statement about meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.** Trump and his advisers agreed that Trump Jr. should release a statement in order to get out in front of the story. The statement claimed that the meeting was "not a campaign issue at the time," but that they "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children," which was later shown to be misleading. Trump's decision to intervene in the response had not previously been reported. Rudy Giuliani responded, saying that "our recollection keeps changing" about the meeting and that "this is the reason you don't let this president testify in the special counsel's Russia investigation."

2/ **Trump tweeted that Robert Mueller's appointment is "totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!" and asserted that he has the "absolute right to PARDON myself."** Trump, however, said he would "play the game" because he has "done nothing wrong." Over the weekend, Giuliani said Trump "probably" has the power to pardon himself, but that it would be "unthinkable" for him to do so and would "lead to probably an immediate impeachment." He added that Trump "has no need to do that. He didn't do anything wrong."

3/ **Trump's lawyers sent a 20-page letter to Mueller's office asserting that Trump cannot be compelled to testify**. The letter also argues that it's impossible for Trump to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation because the U.S. Constitution empowers the president to, "if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon." Giuliani responded to news of the leaked letter, saying that "if Mueller tries to subpoena us, we're going to court."

4/ **Giuliani bragged that Trump could shoot James Comey in the Oval Office and still wouldn't be indicted for it.** "In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted," Giuliani said. "I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is." Giuliani claimed that the only way Trump could be indicted is if he is impeached first. "If he shot James Comey, he’d be impeached the next day," Giuliani said. "Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him."
