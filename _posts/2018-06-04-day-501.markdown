1/ **Trump tweeted that Robert Mueller's appointment is "totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!" and asserted that he has the "absolute right to PARDON myself."** Trump, however, said he would "play the game" because he has "done nothing wrong." Over the weekend, Giuliani said Trump "probably" has the power to pardon himself, but that it would be "unthinkable" for him to do so and would "lead to probably an immediate impeachment." He added that Trump "has no need to do that. He didn't do anything wrong."

2/ **Trump's lawyers sent a 20-page letter to Mueller's office asserting that Trump cannot be compelled to testify**. The letter also argues that it's impossible for Trump to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation because the U.S. Constitution empowers the president to, "if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon." Giuliani responded to news of the leaked letter, saying that "if Mueller tries to subpoena us, we're going to court" and that "our recollection keeps changing" about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting and that "this is the reason you don't let this president testify in the special counsel's Russia investigation." The letter confirms that Trump dictated a "short but accurate" statement issued by Trump Jr. about his 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer who an intermediary claimed had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton.

3/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to answers about her August 2017 claim that Trump "certainly didn't dictate" the Trump Tower statement**. [At the time](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/01/day-194/#2-the-white-house-said-trump-only-we), Sanders said Trump only "weighed in" on Trump Jr.'s statement about the Russia meeting, saying "the statement that Don Jr. issued is true, there's no inaccuracy in the statement."

* **Day 194: Dictated**. Trump personally dictated Trump Jr.'s statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer, saying they had "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children" when they met in June 2016.

4/ **Giuliani bragged that Trump could shoot James Comey in the Oval Office and still wouldn't be indicted for it.** "In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted," Giuliani said. "I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is." Giuliani claimed that the only way Trump could be indicted is if he is impeached first. "If he shot James Comey, he’d be impeached the next day," Giuliani said. "Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him."

5/ **The White House ordered Cabinet members to publicly support Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal last year**. Emails reveal that the White House told all of Trump's top secretaries to "prep statements of support for the decision being announced," saying there were "no exceptions."
