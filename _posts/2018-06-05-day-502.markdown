1/ **Trump blamed Jeff Sessions for the ongoing Russia investigation into possible collusion**, lamented asking Sessions to lead the Justice Department, and suggested that the probe would have been shut down by now if Sessions had not recused himself. In a tweet, Trump said the "Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-blames-sessions-for-russia-probe-suggests-he-could-have-shut-it-down/2018/06/05/19023474-68b2-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/pressure-builds-on-attorney-general-sessions-as-trump-pours-on-blame-idUSKCN1J11R3) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/trump-sessions-mueller-russia-624181))

* **Trump demanded to know "what is taking so long" in the release of the Justice Department inspector general's report into the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server**.

* **The Trump administration ended its effort to appoint the Justice Department's No. 3 official** after at least two potential candidates said they weren't interested in the position. The associate attorney general position would be responsible for overseeing the Mueller probe if Rod Rosenstein were to depart. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-sidelines-effort-to-appoint-justice-department-no-3-1528208396))

2/ **Robert Mueller's team accused Paul Manafort of felony witness tampering** in his federal tax and money laundering case. Prosecutors say Manafort attempted to contact witnesses by phone through an intermediary and through an encrypted messaging program in order to "suborn perjury," otherwise known as trying to convince someone to lie under oath. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/paul-manafort-mueller-witness-tampering.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/manafort-attempted-to-tamper-with-potential-witnesses-u-s-special-counsel-idUSKCN1J1043) / [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/paul-manafort-loses-his-cool/562034/))

3/ **A federal judge scheduled a hearing for June 15 on whether to revoke bail for Manafort** for allegedly trying to tamper with potential witnesses while on a $10 million pretrial release. Judge Amy Berman is expected to rule on whether Manafort will have to go to jail pending his trial or whether the terms of his bail are further restricted.

4/ **Putin claimed that he and Trump have a close working relationship and "regularly talk over the phone."** When asked why there has not been a bilateral summit between Putin and the Trump administration, he said "this is the result of the ongoing acute political struggle in the United States." Putin continued: "Indeed, Donald Trump and I have, firstly, met more than once at various international venues and secondly, we regularly talk over the phone."

5/ **Mitch McConnell canceled most of the Senate's August recess** due to "the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president's nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year." The move will keep Democrats up for re-election off the campaign trail while pushing through confirmations for as many of Trump's judicial and executive branch nominees as possible. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/mitch-mcconnell-says-senates-august-recess-is-canceled.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/mitch-mcconnell-cancels-august-recess-1528219488-5e059e36-37ff-4f25-92b8-915cb78bf0eb.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/mcconnell-cancels-most-of-august-recess-625905))

6/ **A New York state judge has ruled that Trump can be deposed in a defamation lawsuit brought last year by Summer Zervos**, the former contestant on "The Apprentice" who accused Trump of kissing and groping her. The judge set a Jan. 31, 2019, deadline for discovery in the lawsuit and ordered both parties to submit to depositions. Zervos sued Trump for defamation after he called her accusations "100% false" and began calling her "phony people coming up with phony allegations." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/trump-depose-summer-zervos-lawsuit-624186) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/simmer-zervos-deadline-trump-deposition) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390744-new-york-judge-rules-defamation-suit-against-trump-can-move-forward))

7/ **Trump canceled the Philadelphia Eagles planned White House visit** to celebrate their Super Bowl championship less than 24 hours before the players were expected to arrive. Several Eagles players said they would skip the ceremony. Trump had "insist\[ed\] that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart." ([Philly.com](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/trump-eagles-white-house-cancellation-20180604.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-disinvites-philadelphia-eagles-from-white-house-visit-citing-national-anthem-dispute/2018/06/04/d23ffa84-684e-11e8-bbc5-dc9f3634fa0a_story.html))

* **LeBron James said neither the Cleveland Cavaliers nor the Golden State Warriors want an invite to the White House**. "I know no matter who wins this series, no one wants an invite anyway. It won't be Cleveland or Golden State going." Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr added that "it will be nice when things get back to normal in three years." LeBron called Trump a "bum" last year after Trump disinvited Stephen Curry and the Warriors from the White House.

8/ **Betsy DeVos told lawmakers that the White House's school safety commission will not examine the role of guns in school violence**, saying "that is not part of the commission's charge, per se." Trump established the Federal Commission on School Safety in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. to "study and make recommendations" on a variety of topics, including age restrictions for certain gun purchases." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/c8f50f582d774699822985a2af44b612) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/trump-school-safety-guns-betsy-devos-1343451) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390770-devos-safety-commission-wont-look-at-role-of-guns-in-school-violence))
