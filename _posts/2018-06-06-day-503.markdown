1/ **Stormy Daniels filed a new lawsuit against her former attorney and Michael Cohen**, saying the two men "colluded" and "acted in concert" to "manipulate" her in order to benefit Trump. The lawsuit alleges that as a part of the effort to deny Trump's affair with Daniels, her former attorney, Keith Davidson, and Cohen "hatched a plan to have Ms. Clifford appear on Mr. Sean Hannity's program to falsely deny the accuracy of the In Touch article" in January. In Touch magazine published excerpts from its 2011 interview with Daniels in which she said she had an affair with Trump starting in 2006. It was [revealed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/04/16/day-452/#5-michael-cohen-also-represents-sean) in April that Cohen also represents Hannity. Daniels' current attorney, Michael Avenatti, called the private messages evidence that "prior denials by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen relating to what Mr. Trump knew, and about the honesty of my client, were absolute lies," adding that "there was a significant cover-up here as part of an attempt to deceive the American people and Mrs. Trump and we intend on getting to the bottom of it."

2/ **Ivanka Trump connected Michael Cohen with a Russian who offered to introduce Trump to Putin during the campaign** in 2015 in order to facilitate a 100-story Trump Tower in Moscow. Mueller's team and congressional investigators have reviewed emails and questioned witnesses about the interaction. There is no evidence that Ivanka's contact with former Olympic weightlifter Dmitry Klokov was illegal or election related.

3/ **Robert Mueller requested that witnesses turn in their personal phones so investigators can inspect their encrypted messages** on WhatsApp, Confide, Signal and Dust. The revelation comes as the special counsel filed a claim that Paul Manafort tampered with witnesses through the same types of programs.

4/ **Giuliani claimed Mueller's team is "trying very, very hard to frame \[Trump\] to get him in trouble when he hasn't done anything wrong."** He added that Mueller's team "can't emotionally come to grips with the fact that this whole thing with Russian collusion didn't happen. They are trying to invent theories of obstruction of justice." Giuliani also reiterated the claim that Trump has the power to pardon himself, but won't do so because "he's innocent" and "he hasn't done anything wrong."

5/ **Paul Ryan agreed that there is "no evidence" to support claims that the FBI spied on Trump's 2016 campaign for political purposes** by using a confidential informant to contact members of the campaign while investigating its ties to Russia. Ryan added that Trump should not try to pardon himself, saying, "I don't know the technical answer to that question, but I think obviously the answer is he shouldn't. And no one is above the law."
