1/ **Rudy Giuliani to Stormy Daniels: "I don't respect a porn star the way I respect a career woman or a woman of substance."** He added that being a porn star "entitles you to no degree of giving your credibility any weight." Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, called Giuliani an "absolute, disgusting pig" and demanded Trump fire him "immediately." He added that "it doesn't matter what a woman's profession is. It has nothing to do with their credibility or whether they should be respected." Giuliani defended his statement, saying: "I don't have to undermine her credibility. She's done it by lying."

2/ **The Justice Department will brief lawmakers next week about the FBI's use of an informant** in connection with its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The new offer is a concession to Republican demands for more information about the probe. The Justice Department and FBI "are prepared to brief members on certain questions specifically raised by the speaker and other members" and allow lawmakers "to review certain supporting documents that were made available during the prior briefing." Democrats are concerned that the briefings could allow Trump's legal team access to sensitive details of the investigation.

3/ **Adam Schiff called on Republicans to release the House Intelligence Committee interview transcripts related to the Russia investigation**, saying they could shed "additional light on the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice."

4/ **Sean Hannity suggested that witnesses in Robert Mueller's probe "follow Hillary Clinton's lead" by destroying their personal phones before handing them over to prosecutors.** Hannity told witnesses to "delete all your emails and then acid-wash your emails and hard drives on the phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer to little itsy bitsy pieces." Hand them over to Mueller, Hannity continued, "and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law." Hannity later insisted that he was kidding.

5/ **Colin Kaepernick's lawyers plan to subpoena Trump and Pence as part of his collusion case against the NFL** in an attempt to gain information about Trump's political involvement with NFL owners.

"The outspoken members of the Consumer Advisory Board seem more concerned about protecting their taxpayer funded junkets to Washington, D.C., and being wined and dined by the Bureau than protecting consumers," said a spokesperson for the agency.
