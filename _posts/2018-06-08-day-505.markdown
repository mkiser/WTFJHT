1/ **Robert Mueller filed witness tampering criminal charges against Paul Manafort and Russian national Konstantin Kilimnik**. The superseding indictment charges the two men with obstructing justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and witness tampering. Kilimnik was indicted as part of the existing money laundering case against Manafort, who is also accused of illegal foreign lobbying and lying to federal officials. It's the first time Kilimnik was named, who was referred to as "Person A" and described as having links to Russian spy agencies in previous court filings.

2/ **A former Senate Intelligence Committee aide was arrested and charged with lying to the FBI about contacts with three reporters as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information**. James Wolfe repeatedly denied contacts with the reporters despite having been in a three-year relationship with New York Times reporter Ali Watkins. The Justice Department seized Watkins' phone and email records, which news media advocates consider to be an intrusion of First Amendment freedoms.

3/ **Trump called on the G7 to reinstate Russia after it was kicked out for annexing Crimea four years ago**, putting him at odds with world leaders who have insisted that Moscow remain ostracized. "Russia should be in this meeting," Trump said. "Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? ... Whether you like it or not, and it may not be politically correct, but we have a world to run." Trump also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, and is now engaged in a series of trade wars with numerous countries in Europe, North America and Asia. Trump will leave the G7 summit early.

4/ **The Trump administration will not defend the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate from a legal challenge to its constitutionality** brought by Texas and 19 other states. The Justice Department said the ACA provision requiring most Americans to buy health insurance has become unconstitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012 as the government's power to tax. The Justice Department argues that since Congress repealed the tax last year, the mandate and the law's consumer protections are no longer justified. California and 15 other states have filed a brief defending the law and its consumer protections.

5/ **Stormy Daniels' former attorney filed a defamation claim against her and Michael Avenatti**. Keith Davidson's lawsuit against Daniels and Avenatti is in response to Daniels' accusation that he colluded with Michael Cohen to help Trump. Davidson filed a separate claim against Cohen for allegedly illegally recording their phone calls. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/politics/stormy-daniels-ex-attorney-sues/index.html))

6/ **Rudy Giuliani claimed Melania Trump "believes her husband, and she knows itâ€™s untrue \[that Trump had an affair with Stormy Daniels\]."** Melania's office responded: "I don't believe Mrs. Trump has ever discussed her thoughts on anything with Mr. Giuliani." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ladys-office-pushes-back-giuliani-stormy-daniels-comment/story?id=55731627) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-melania-trump-stormy-daniels-north-korea.html))
