1/ **Trump refused to endorse the G7 statement, threatened to impose tariffs on foreign auto imports, and accused Justin Trudeau of being "meek," "very dishonest and weak"** after Canada's prime minister pledged to retaliate against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products. In a pair of tweets aboard Air Force One, Trump said he believes that countries are ripping off the U.S. through high tariffs and threatened to stop all trade with any country that did not lower or eliminate tariffs. The pair of tweets came hours after Trump and European leaders had agreed on a joint communiqu√©, which included a pledge to engage in "free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade and investment."

* **In April, Trump told French president Emmanuel Macron that the European Union is "worse than China."** In their bilateral meeting in the White House's Cabinet Room, Macron said to Trump, "Let's work together, we both have a China problem." Trump "then went on a rant about Germany and cars." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-eu-worse-than-china-trade-tariffs-57f53e00-8b5c-4931-9d05-97ee0b510fd5.html))

* **France: Trump's "incoherence and inconsistency" would not upend international cooperation**, said a statement released by French president Macron's office. It added that partnerships "cannot depend on fits of anger or little words. Let us be serious and worthy of our people." ([Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-trump-g7-france-blasts-incoherent-after-summit-fiasco/))

2/ **Trump's economic adviser accused Justin Trudeau of "betrayal" for making Trump look weak before his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un**. Trudeau promised to "move forward with retaliatory measures" in response to Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico. Trudeau called the tariffs "kind of insulting" and saying that Canadians "are nice" but "we will not be pushed around." Larry Kudlow said Trudeau "stabbed us in the back," and that Trump "is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around. He is not going to permit any show of weakness on a trip to negotiate with North Korea." Kudlow went on to call Trudeau "amateurish" and "sophomoric." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/us/politics/trump-kudlow-g7.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-kudlow/white-house-adviser-says-canadas-trudeau-stabbed-us-in-the-back-cnn-idUSKBN1J60MU) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/10/politics/larry-kudlow-donald-trump-justin-trudeau/index.html))

* **Trump's "bully" attack on Trudeau outrages Canadians**. "It was extremely undiplomatic and antagonistic," Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States, said. "It was disrespectful and ill informed." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/canada/g-7-justin-trudeau-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/trudeau-takes-his-turn-as-trumps-principal-antagonist-and-canadians-rally-around/2018/06/10/162edcf8-6cc6-11e8-b4d8-eaf78d4c544c_story.html))

* **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is "unconcerned" about the diplomatic crisis caused by Trump's insults directed at the Canadian prime minister**, saying "there are always irritants in relationships."

3/ **White House trade adviser Peter Navarro: "There's a special place in hell" for Trudeau and world leaders who double cross Trump**. "And that's what bad-faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference." When asked whether the president agreed, Navarro said the sentiment came "right from Air Force One."

* **Putin: Criticism of Russia's "so-called destabilizing efforts" in the West is "unfounded,"** and that "this creative babbling" by world leaders has so far "led to nothing." Putin said he'd welcome a meeting with Trump. ([Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-says-g7-criticism-is-babbling-happy-to-hold-talks-with-donald-trump-us/))

4/ **Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to most victims of domestic abuse and gang violence**. The move effectively blocks tens of thousands of people ‚Äì women in particular ‚Äì from seeking refuge in America. Sessions ruled that a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision protecting women from Central America from domestic violence was wrongly decided, saying victims of "private" crimes like domestic violence do not qualify for asylum. Immigration courts are housed under the Justice Department ‚Äì not the judiciary branch ‚Äì which means Sessions has the authority to refer cases to himself and overturn earlier decisions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/politics/sessions-domestic-violence-asylum.html) / [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-sessions-asylum-20180611-story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/jeff-sessions-asylum-decision/index.html))

5/ **Trump will leave the North Korea summit a day early because nuclear negotiations have moved "more quickly than expected."** The White House said Trump and Kim Jong Un will hold a one-on-one meeting, accompanied only by translators, followed by a "working lunch" with an expanded group of officials. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lowered expectations, saying the summit might yield little in the way of concrete success. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/f4a5201ceceb44f896e2e497537ba116/Trump-to-leave-summit-early-_-after-meeting-with-Kim) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/11/trump-kim-jong-un-meeting-635363))

* **Trump will not bring up human rights issues at the North Korea summit**. Kim Jong Un's country has committed "unspeakable atrocities" on a scale reminiscent of Nazi Germany, according to a 2014 United Nations investigation. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/u-s-won-t-bring-north-korea-s-human-rights-n880986))

* **Trump is willing to consider establishing official relations with North Korea and eventually opening an embassy in Pyongyang**. "It would all depend what he gets in return," said a source close to the White House. "Denuclearization would have to be happening."
