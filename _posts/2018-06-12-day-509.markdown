1/ **The Justice Department argued that Trump could continue to profit from foreign governments visiting his hotel in Washington, D.C.,** if he didn't explicitly provide something in return. A federal judge criticized the argument that Trump's financial interest in the Trump International Hotel in D.C. is constitutional. The lawsuit, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland, claims that Trump's profits from the hotel violate the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government employees from receiving financial benefits outside of their official salary. The judge promised to decide by the end of the July whether to allow the case to proceed to the next stage.

2/ **Michael Cohen told friends he believes he will soon be indicted and arrested** as part of Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump's campaign and Russia. Investigators are probing Cohen for bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. ([NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-trump-michael-cohen-arrested-any-day-20180612-story.html))

* **Michael Avenatti claimed that the Russian government is trying to plant false stories about him in the press**. Avenatti said people in the Russian government claimed that he traveled to Moscow and had questionable encounters with women there, and that he previously represented Russian and Ukrainian legal interests before the U.S. government. "I've never been to Moscow in my life," Avenatti said. "I've never traveled to Russia in my life." ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-avenatti-the-russians-are-trying-to-run-a-smear-job-on-me))

3/ **Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump earned at least $82 million in outside income while serving as Trump's advisers during 2017.** Kushner reported more than $5 million in income from a Kushner Companies apartment complex in Plainsboro, N.J. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-and-ivanka-trump-made-at-least-82-million-in-outside-income-last-year-while-serving-in-the-white-house-filings-show/2018/06/11/a41d0720-6dab-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cc17e4068a68))

4/ **Ivanka Trump personally made $3.9 million last year from her stake in the Trump International Hotel**. She made an additional $5 million from businesses connected to her personal brand, as well as roughly $2 million in 2017 in pay and severance from the Trump Payroll Corp. Her reported income in 2017 was up "substantially" from spring 2017, when she reported about $2.4 million in income from the hotel since it opened in September 2016. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/11/ivanka-trump-international-hotel-profit-637361))

5/ **Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee want to interview Ivanka Trump** as part of the investigation into Russian election interference. The committee wants to interview Ivanka about "two separate national security questions." Sen. Ron Wyden said investigators should ask about her role in connecting a Russian weightlifter, Dmitry Klokov, with Michael Cohen. Klokov offered to connect her father to Putin in order to facilitate building a Trump Tower in Moscow[^1]. The other issue Wyden said investigators should ask about is China's decision to grant Ivanka trademarks around the same time her father promised to help Chinese telecom manufacturer ZTE stay in business. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/democrats-want-to-interview-ivanka-trump-in-the-russia-probe))

6/ **The Senate blocked Trump's deal with Chinese telecom giant ZTE.** The Senate's move comes less than a week after Trump struck a deal with ZTE that would keep the company in business with U.S. companies and markets[^2]. The ZTE deal would have forced the company to pay $1 billion in penalties, reorganize itself, and insert U.S. compliance officers into the company in exchange for access to U.S. consumers. ZTE is considered by the U.S. intelligence community to be a mechanism for espionage by selling phones that can be tracked and enabled to steal intellectual property.

7/ **Trumps said Justin Trudeau's comment that Canada "will not be pushed around" will end up costing Canadians "a lot of money."** Trump added that Trudeau "probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions," in reference to Trudeau's comment after the G7 meeting that the aluminum and steel tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canada on national security grounds were insulting. Trump added the Trudeau "learned" his lesson for criticizing him. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/trump-says-trudeaus-comments-are-going-to-cost-canada-a-lot-of-money.html) / [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-says-trudeau-has-learned-from-mistake-of-criticizing-him-and/))

* **White House trade adviser Peter Navarro apologized for his "special place in hell" comments** directed at Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-navarro/white-houses-navarro-apologizes-for-special-place-in-hell-comment-idUSKBN1J8205?))

8/ **A federal judge ordered Robert Mueller to identify all the key figures referred to but not named in an indictment accusing Paul Manafort of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Ukraine** and of laundering millions of dollars. Mueller's team has until Friday to turn over the names to Manafort's lawyers. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/mueller-unnamed-figures-manafort-638800) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/judge-government-must-reveal-identities-of-figures-in-manafort-case.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/judge-orders-mueller-probe-to-turn-over-names-of-european-politicians-in-alleged-manafort-lobbying-scheme/2018/06/12/9467ab0a-6e50-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-12/mueller-must-reveal-identities-of-foreign-agents-to-manafort))

* **Paul Manafort will be arraigned on Friday for witness tampering charges lodged by Robert Mueller**. It's the third superseding indictment by Mueller against Manafort and the arraignment coincides with Manafort's previously scheduled hearing on whether his $10 million bail should be revoked due to witness tampering accusations. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/ex-trump-campaign-aide-manafort-to-be-arraigned-on-new-charges-friday-idUSKBN1J725M))

Trump used the term "war games," a phrase preferred by Pyongyang, which characterizes them as rehearsals for an invasion. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/trump-kim-summitmeeting.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/trump-kim-meeting-press-conference-637544) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/c4c30dbcc81c458c9ea12b63716c1317))
