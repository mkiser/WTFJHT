4/ **Rod Rosenstein plans to call on the House general counsel to investigate the conduct of House Intelligence Committee staff**. Committee staffers [claimed](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/12/rosenstein-threatened-to-subpoena-gop-led-committee-in-chilling-clash-over-records-emails-show.html) Rosenstein threatened to "subpoena" emails, phone records and other documents during a tense meeting earlier this year, which one aide described as a "personal attack." The Justice Department disputes the account, saying Rosenstein "was making the point – after being threatened with contempt" by House Republicans that "he would have the right to defend himself, including requesting production of relevant emails and text messages and calling them as witnesses to demonstrate that their allegations are false." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/rod-rosenstein-house-investigation/index.html))

5/ **Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe is suing the Justice Department and the FBI**. His lawyers claim McCabe has been denied access to materials related to his firing that he needs to defend himself in connection with allegations of misconduct. McCabe was fired from the FBI in March, less than two days shy of his retirement date. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/andrew-mccabe-justice-department-643386) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/mccabe-doj-lawsuit/index.html))

6/ **Robert Mueller revealed new evidence that Paul Manafort directed an unregistered lobbying campaign in the U.S.** on behalf of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Mueller's team released two memos from 2013 that detail Manafort's involvement in influencing debate in Congress and the press about the imprisonment of Yanukovych's main political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/mueller-manafort-evidence-ukraine-lobbying-643476))

* **Mueller filed a request for 150 blank subpoenas** in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Paul Manafort lives. The two-page filing says each subpoena recipient must appear in the Alexandria, Va., courthouse on July 25 to testify in the case. The 150 blank subpoenas represent 75 total possible witnesses. ([Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/robert-mueller-files-request-for-150-blank-subpoenas-in-paul-manafort-case))

7/ **Mueller's office claimed that Russian intelligence agencies are trying to meddle in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections**. Prosecutors are trying to block foreign intelligence agencies and defendants from seeing evidence in the investigation of interference in the 2016 election, lest this "result in the release of information that would assist foreign intelligence services" and others in future operations against the U.S. Last February, Mueller obtained a grand jury indictment of three Russian companies and 13 Russian individuals on charges they sought to influence the 2016 presidential race. The only defendant in that case is the Russian firm Concord Management and Consulting, which is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman known as Putin's chef. The pretrial process entitles a defendant the material assembled during the investigation. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/mueller-russia-midterms-influence-641851))
