1/ **The New York State attorney general sued Trump and his three eldest children for "persistent illegal conduct" at the Donald J. Trump Foundation**. The lawsuit alleges that Trump repeatedly misused the nonprofit, violating campaign finance laws, engaging in self-dealing to decorate one of his golf clubs, and illegally coordinating with his presidential campaign to stage a multimillion-dollar giveaway during a 2016 campaign event. The state asked to dissolve the foundation and distribute its remaining $1 million in assets to other charities, and force Trump to pay at least $2.8 million in restitution and penalties. Trump attacked the lawsuit on Twitter, calling it an attempt by the "sleazy New York Democrats" to damage him. He vowed not to settle the case.

2/ **The Inspector General Report: James Comey "deviated" from FBI and Justice Department procedures while investigating Hillary Clinton** and her use of a private email server. The report concluded that Comey's decisions were not "the result of political bias," but that his "decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice." Trump has argued that FBI agents tried to rig the Clinton investigation to help her win the presidency. The report also concludes that the text messages exchanged by FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page did not improperly affect the investigation, but "the conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation."

3/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy press secretary Raj Shah are planning to leave the White House**,according to a CBS News report. Sanders plans to leave by the end of the year, while Shah hasn't settled on an exact date. Sanders denied the report, tweeting: "Does @CBSNews know something I don't about my plans and my future? I was at my daughter's year-end Kindergarten event and they ran a story about my 'plans to leave the WH' without even talking to me. I love my job and am honored to work for @POTUS."

4/ **Jeff Sessions cited the Bible in his defense of the Trump administration's policy of separating undocumented immigrant children from their families**. Sessions invoked the Apostle Paul for his "clear and wise command" to say people should "obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes." Sarah Huckabee Sanders also defended separating parents from their children, saying it's "very biblical to enforce the law." She then proceeded to blame on Democrats for refusing to "close the immigration loophole."

5/ **White House Counsel Don McGahn recused his entire staff from Robert Mueller's investigation** last summer because many staffers "had been significant participants" in the firings of Michael Flynn and James Comey. Former White House lawyer Ty Cobb said McGahn's recusal was a key reason why he was hired last summer to manage Trump's response to the Russia investigation.

* **Trump Jr. told the hosts of "Fox and Friends" that "it would be stupid" of Trump to agree to an interview with Robert Mueller**. "I don't think any proper lawyer would say, 'Hey, you should go do it,' because it's not about collusion anymore," Trump Jr. said. "It's about, 'Can we get him to say something that may be interpreted as somewhat off or inaccurate, and after 50,000 questions, maybe you make a mistake, and that's how we get you, and that's ridiculous." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/14/donald-trump-jr-mueller-investigation-interview-645620))

6/ **The White House launched a campaign to discredit Michael Cohen as speculation that he is preparing to flip on Trump continues to mount.** The plan involves discrediting Cohen by arguing that whatever compromising information he shares with prosecutors about Trump is a lie meant to please Mueller in order to save his own skin. The plan includes everything from Trump's tweets, to comments from Alan Dershowitz, to front-page stories in the National Enquirer, all apparently intended to cast doubt on Cohen's credibility and motives.
