1/ **Hundreds of children separated from their parents are waiting inside cages in an old warehouse in south Texas** while they wait to be turned over to shelters funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. The cages were described as the type you'd see at a batting cage or a dog kennel. More than 1,100 people are being held inside facility, which is divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults, and mothers and fathers with children.

* **Ann Coulter called the children crying at the border after being separated from parents "child actors."** Trump Jr., meanwhile, liked a Breitbart tweet that quoted Coulter, who said the separated children had been "coached" by liberals and "given scripts to read." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/392774-ann-coulter-calls-immigrant-children-child-actors) / [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jr-likes-tweet-suggesting-children-separated-parents-border-are-981126)) 

2/ **Lawmakers from both parties demanded that Trump stop his policy of separating children from their parents at the border.** Republican lawmakers, Laura Bush, a conservative newspaper, and a former Trump adviser joined with Democrats in condemning the policy that has removed nearly 2,000 children from their parents over the last six weeks. Melania Trump, meanwhile, placed the blame on "both sides," saying that she "hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/politics/melania-trump-family-separation.html))

3/ **The White House continued to falsely blame Democrats for the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their families**. The separations stem from Jeff Sessions' "zero-tolerance" policy announced last month. Via tweet, Trump blamed Democrats for being "weak and ineffective with Border Security and Crime" while urging them to agree to immigration legislation and to fund his border wall. Trump added that "the United States will not be a migrant camp... not on my watch."

* **Jeb Bush called on Trump to end the "heartless policy"** of separating parents and children who cross the U.S. border illegally, saying "children shouldn't be used as a negotiating tool." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/18/jeb-bush-trump-child-separations-650883))

4/ **The United Nations' top human rights official called for the U.S. to immediately stop separating children from their families at the border**. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein condemned the practice as "government-sanctioned child abuse," saying "the thought that any state would seek to deter parents by inflicting such abuse on children is unconscionable." U.S.  Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley called al-Hussein's statement hypocritical, saying "neither the United Nations nor anyone else will dictate how the United States upholds its borders."

5/ **Trump warned that the U.S. must avoid Europe's immigration problems**, falsely claiming that "crime in Germany is way up." The opposite, however, is true. Germany's crime rate has fallen to its lowest level since 1992.

6/ **Peter Strzok said he would be willing to testify without immunity and without invoking the 5th Amendment** before the House Judiciary Committee and any other congressional committee. Strzok was removed from Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election for sending anti-Trump texts. Strzok's lawyer said: "He thinks that his position, character and actions have all been misrepresented and caricatured, and he wants an opportunity to remedy that." Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that Strzok was a "sick loser."

7/ **Roger Stone met with a Russian national during the 2016 campaign who wanted Trump to pay $2 million for the political dirt on Hillary Clinton**. Stone failed to disclose the May 2016 meeting with Henry Greenberg, who also goes by the name Henry Oknyansky, to congressional investigators. The meeting was set up by Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo. Stone rejected the offer and soon after Caputo texted Stone asking if anything interesting came of the meeting. Stone replied: "waste of time." Both Stone and Caputo did not disclose the Greenberg meeting during testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Caputo said he failed to disclose the encounter because he had "simply forgotten" about the meeting. Mueller is now investigating the previously undisclosed meeting.

* **Roger Stone is "not concerned" that he failed to tell Congress about his 2016 meeting with a Russian national offering dirt on Hillary Clinton**. "I just didn't remember. 2016 was a pretty busy year," Stone said. "I don't think a failure of memory constitutes a perjury."
