1/ **Michael Cohen has signaled that he is "willing to give" investigators information on Trump** in order to alleviate pressure on himself and his family. Cohen has hired New York lawyer Guy Petrillo to represent him in the federal investigation into his business dealings and wants Trump to pay his legal fees. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/michael-cohen-criminal-lawyer-guy-petrillo/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-cohen-wants-trump-to-pay-his-legal-fees-1529447136))

2/ **Trump accused Democrats of wanting "illegal immigrants ... to pour into and infest our country."** Trump also rejected a proposal by Senator Ted Cruz to end family separations, calling the plan to hire thousands of new immigration judges "crazy" and suggesting the judges could be corrupt. Trump argued that undocumented immigrants could "game the system" by taking counsel from immigration lawyers and reading statements prepared for them.

3/ **The Trump administration has lost track of nearly 6,000 unaccompanied migrant children** – thousands more than the Department of Health and Human Services had previously acknowledged. HHS placed more than 42,497 unaccompanied children with sponsors in fiscal year 2017. Officials tasked with reaching out to sponsors and children to check on their well-being said 14% of calls were not returned – meaning the Trump administration has lost track of 5,949 children.

4/ **More than 600 members of Jeff Sessions' church filed a formal complaint accusing him of "child abuse,"** "immorality," and "racial discrimination" for his "zero-tolerance" immigration policy that has led to children getting separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hundreds-sessions-church-file-formal-complaint-accusing-child/story?id=56003177))

* **A bipartisan group of former U.S. attorneys called on Jeff Sessions to end the policy of separating families at the border**. "Like a majority of Americans," they wrote, "we are appalled that your Zero Tolerance policy has resulted in the unnecessary trauma and suffering of innocent children." ([Medium](https://medium.com/@formerusattorneys/bipartisan-group-of-former-united-states-attorneys-call-on-sessions-to-end-child-detention-e129ae0df0cf))

5/ **Trump threatened to shut down the government in September if Congress doesn't provide $25 billion for his border wall**. Senators are currently willing to send Trump $1.6 billion this fall. If Trump follows through with his threat, a government shutdown would happen weeks before the midterm elections.

* **Trump Jr. has withdrawn from a fundraiser for George P. Bush because of criticism from the Bush family over immigration policy**. Yesterday, Jeb Bush [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/1008730704497258496): "Children shouldn't be used as a negotiating tool. @realDonaldTrump should end this heartless policy and Congress should get an immigration deal done that provides for asylum reform, border security and a path to citizenship for Dreamers." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/donald-trump-jr-george-p-bush-fundraiser/index.html))

6/ **The U.S. backed out of the United Nations Human Rights Council**. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the council "a cesspool of political bias" that is a "hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights" and "is not worthy of its name." The withdrawal comes a day after the U.N.'s human rights chief called Trump's policy of separating children from parents crossing the southern border illegally "unconscionable."

7/ **Trump threatened China with another $200 billion in tariffs if Beijing refuses to narrow the trade deficit**, which he says has put the U.S. "at a permanent and unfair disadvantage." China's Commerce Ministry accused Trump of initiating a trade war. In total, the Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of goods. The U.S. imported $505 billion in goods from China last year.

## Notables.

 1. **The Trump administration rolled back consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act** that health plans provide certain "essential health benefits" like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.
