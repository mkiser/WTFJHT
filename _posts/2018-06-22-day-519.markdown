1/ **Paul Ryan abruptly delayed a vote on a "compromise" immigration package until next week**, as Republicans search for a way to get 218 votes to pass the measure. The bill would provide $25 billion for Trump's border wall, offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and keep migrant families together in detention centers. It was the second time the bill has been delayed this week.

2/ **Trump told Republicans to "stop wasting their time on Immigration" until after the midterms**, predicting that more Republicans will be elected to Congress, and accusing Democrats of creating "phony stories of sadness and grief" on the border. Three days ago, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1009076294615814145) that "now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration." Trump's comments came shortly after Republican House leaders postponed a vote on a broad immigration bill.

4/ **About 500 of the more than 2,300 children who were separated from their parents have been reunited**. The Department of Homeland Security said it has stopped referring members of detained families to the Department of Justice for prosecution. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hundreds-separated-migrant-families-reunited/story?id=56081072))

5/ **The Pentagon will house up to 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children at military bases** "for occupancy as early as July through December 31, 2018." The Navy is also preparing plans to construct "temporary and austere" tent cities to house 25,000 migrants at abandoned airfields in Florida and Alabama. The proposed plans also call for camps near San Francisco and at Camp Pendleton along the Southern California coast that would hold as many as 47,000 people each.

6/ **The National Enquirer regularly sent Michael Cohen copies of stories related to Trump in advance of publication during the 2016 presidential campaign**. The company denied the practice, but three sources say it continued even after Trump took office. If "it was a story specifically about Trump," one person said, "then it was sent over to Michael, and as long as there were no objections from him, the story could be published." Cohen's efforts to limit negative stories about Trump during the campaign has prosecutors looking into whether he broke campaign finance laws.
