1/ **Trump: "We must immediately" send immigrants who illegally enter the U.S. "back from where they came" with "no Judges or Court Cases."** Trump likened immigrants and asylum seekers to intruders trying to "break into" the country, saying "we cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-calls-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants-with-no-judges-or-court-cases-idUSKBN1JK0OL?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNewsFBChatbot) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-advocates-depriving-undocumented-immigrants-of-due-process-rights/2018/06/24/dfa45d36-77bd-11e8-93cc-6d3beccdd7a3_story.html?utm_term=.62c65846a2b0) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-judges-due-process.html))

2/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that "just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you don't receive due process,"** as she defended Trump's statement that people who illegally cross the border should be removed "with no Judges or Court Cases." Trump tweeted that "hiring manythousands \[sic\] of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional \[sic\]. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/394029-white-house-just-because-you-dont-see-a-judge-doesnt-mean-you-dont) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-doubles-turning-undocumented-immigrants-due-process/story?id=56142083))

3/ **The commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection will stop referring immigrants with children to the Justice Department for prosecution** until CBP and the DOJ can "agree on a policy that would allow parents to be prosecuted without separating them from their children." Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there was no change to the administration's "zero tolerance" policy and that "we're not changing the policy. We're simply out of resources." Jeff Sessions, meanwhile, told a group of school resources offers in Reno, Nevada that "we're going to continue to prosecute those adults who enter here illegally. We're going to do everything in our power, however, to avoid separating families. All federal agencies are working hard to accomplish this goal." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/border-officials-suspend-handing-over-migrant-families-to-prosecutors.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/sessions-zero-tolerance-immigration/index.html))

* **The Department of Homeland Security said it's reunited 522 children with parents**. 2,053 separated children remain in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The government "knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families," according to a DHS fact sheet. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/u-s-government-reunites-522-children-removed-under-zero-tolerance-idUSKBN1JK01L) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/migrant-children-reunited.html))

* **Jeff Sessions warned activists against "obstructing" ICE or Border Patrol**, saying "free speech, assembly, and protest are and will be protected," but other crimes will not be tolerated." Activists online have threatened to dox ICE employees and publicly shame those who work for the agency. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/24/sessions-border-patrol-safety-667185))

4/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders was kicked out of a Virginia restaurant because she publicly defends the Trump administration's "inhumane and unethical" policies**. The Red Hen's owner, though "not a huge fan of confrontation," said, "This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals." The owner's actions "say far more about her than about me," Sanders tweeted. Trump criticized the restaurant on Twitter, saying that "the Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person." He then offered his personal advice to those dining out: "I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!"

5/ **Trump ally and Blackwater founder Erik Prince provided Robert Mueller with "total access to his phone and computer."** Mueller's team has been scrutinizing allegations that Prince tried to establish a backchannel between the Trump administration and the Kremlin during a January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles. In April 2017, it was [reported](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/04/03/Day-74/#5-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-and) that the United Arab Emirates had arranged the meeting between Prince and a Russian close to Putin. The two-day meeting took place about nine days before Trump's inauguration. [Last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/06/19/day-516/), Prince said he had "spoken voluntarily to Congress" and has "cooperated with the special counsel." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-obtains-trump-ally-erik-princes-phones/story?id=56143477))

6/ **Trump plans to block Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and on the technologies that can be sold to China**. The Dow dropped more than 300 points in response to the aggressive restrictions favored by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over the more conservative approach favored by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. On Sunday, Trump warned America's trade partners to remove trade barriers and tariffs or face the consequences.

* **The bond market's yield curve is warning of a possible recession**. Wall Street is watching the gap between two-year and 10-year interest rates shrink. When long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates, the yield curve has "inverted" and it's "a powerful signal of recessions." Curve inversions have â€œcorrectly signaled all nine recessions since 1955. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/business/what-is-yield-curve-recession-prediction.html))
