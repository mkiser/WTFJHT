1/ **The Supreme Court upheld the third iteration of Trump's travel ban** in a 5-4 ruling along ideological lines. The ban was issued last fall and prevented travelers from eight counties – including six majority-Muslim countries – from entering the U.S. Several states challenged the ban, claiming the order constituted a "Muslim ban," violated Trump's executive authority and the Constitution, and harmed U.S. citizens and educational institutions. Trump seemed surprised by the decision, tweeting "SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!"

2/ **The Supreme Court ruled that "crisis pregnancy centers" don't have to provide women with information about the availability of abortions**. California required that centers post notices about state-offered abortion, contraception and prenatal services available to low-income women, and to provide phone numbers for more information. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates argued that the law violated their right to free speech by forcing them to convey messages at odds with their beliefs. The Supreme Court agreed in a 5-4 vote. "Crisis pregnancy centers" are essentially anti-abortion facilities that seek to prevent abortions that are often located next to or across the street from a traditional, full-service women's reproductive health center.

3/ **Robert Mueller's team plans to produce conclusions and possible indictments related to the Trump-Russia investigation by fall**. Mueller and investigators will then determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Trump attempted to obstruct justice. At least 13 people associated with Trump's presidential campaign had suspicious contacts with Russians.

4/ **Seventeen states sued the Trump administration to force officials to reunite migrant families** who have been separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Health and Human Services Secretary, however, said the Trump administration will not reunite any children with parents held in detention facilities unless current federal law changes or their parents drop their asylum claims and agree to be deported.

5/ **Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oath, Snap and Twitter met with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to discuss the upcoming midterm elections** in an effort to ensure there is not a repeat of Russian interference. The eight tech companies shared details about disinformation campaigns they were witnessing on their platforms. However, neither the FBI nor the DHS provided the tech companies with information about specific threats, prompting frustration from Silicon Valley that intelligence officials weren't preparing them for the midterm elections.
