1/ **Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire from the Supreme Court at the end of July**, giving Trump a second chance to fundamentally shift the court to the right for decades by creating a five-member conservative majority. Kennedy was the court's leading champion of gay rights, who also joined the court's liberals in cases on abortion, affirmative action and the death penalty. Kennedy's decision to retire will impact the midterm elections, as Democrats and Republicans seek control of the Senate, which confirms Supreme Court justices. Senate Democrats currently lack the number of votes needed to deny the seat to Trump's nominee.

* **What Kennedy's departure from the Supreme Court will mean for abortion, gay rights, and more**. Kennedy has been the swing vote on many of the Court’s most ideologically charged decisions.

* **Mitch McConnell promised a Senate vote on a new Supreme Court nominee by the fall**. Trump added that the search for Kennedy's successor will begin "immediately."

* **Charles Schumer called McConnell's determination to vote a Supreme Court nominee before the November midterm elections the "height of hypocrisy" for Republicans**. McConnell kept Justice Antonin Scalia's seat vacant for more than a year after he died, arguing that voters should weigh in during the 2016 presidential election on the ideological balance of the high court.

2/ **The House rejected the latest Republican immigration bill** in a 301 to 121 vote despite a last-minute tweet, all caps tweet of support from Trump. Lawmakers will now leave for their 10-day Fourth of July recess with no resolution on the fate of the Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children.

3/ **A federal judge ordered the federal government to reunite migrant families separated under the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy and to end most family separations**. U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw issued a nationwide injunction requiring that all children under the age of five be reunited with their parents within 14 days and that older children be reunited within 30 days, and temporarily stopping the practice of separating children from their parents. The judge also ordered that all children who have been separated be allowed to talk to their parents within 10 days.

4/ **Jeff Sessions called the outrage over separating migrant children from their families a "radicalized" issue championed by the "lunatic fringe" living in "gated communities."** Sessions was speaking to the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Los Angeles where he suggested that those those who condemn the division of families who cross the border illegally are hypocrites. "These same people live in gated communities, many of them, and are featured at events where you have to have an ID to even come in and hear them speak," Sessions said, "They like a little security around themselves, and if you try to scale the fence, believe me, they'll be even too happy to have you arrested and separated from your children."

5/ **The Supreme Court ruled that non-union public-sector workers cannot be required to pay union fees despite being represented by the union in collective bargaining negotiations**. A 1977 decision made the distinction that forcing nonmembers to pay for a union's political activities violated the First Amendment, but that it was constitutional to require nonmembers to help pay for the union's collective bargaining efforts. More than one-third of public employees are unionized, and public-sector unions stand to lose tens of millions of dollars as a result of the ruling.

6/ **A former Fox News executive is expected to be the next White House communications director**. Bill Shine was forced out as Fox News co-president for how he handled sexual harassment claims at the network. Shine is good friends with Sean Hannity.

7/ **Trump will meet Putin in the next few weeks**, according to national security adviser John Bolton. The meeting is expected to take place in mid-July, when Trump will be in Europe for a previously scheduled NATO summit in Brussels on July 11-12. America's European allies are worried that Trump's meeting with Putin will undermine the NATO summit in the same way Trump clashed with allies at the G7 summit and then praised dictator Kim Jong-un. Asked why the meeting was taking place, Bolton replied: "I'd like to hear someone say this is a bad idea."

8/ **First-time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th Congressional District** on Tuesday. Ocasio-Cortez's grassroots victory is being called one of the most shocking political upsets of the year, marking the first time in 14 years that a member of Crowley's own party attempted to unseat him. Crowley outspent Ocasio-Cortez by a 10-to-1 margin.
