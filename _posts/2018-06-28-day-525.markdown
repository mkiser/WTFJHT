1/ **Paul Manafort owed $10 million to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2018**. The unsealed search warrant application from July 2017 shows that Deripaska financially backed Manafort's consulting work in Ukraine when it started in 2005-06. Robert Mueller also indicted Konstantin Kilimnik, a political operative who served as an intermediary between Manafort and Deripaska, as well as allegedly having ties to Russian spy agencies. The search warrant also confirmed that Mueller has been investigating Manafort's role in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

* **Several billionaires with Kremlin ties attended exclusive, invitation-only receptions during Trump's inauguration festivities** – events typically reserved for top donors and close political allies. Robert Mueller's team has expressed interest in the Russian guests who had no obvious place in Trump's diplomatic orbit ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-eyeing-russians-granted-unusual-access-trump/story?id=56232847))

2/ **Trump and Putin will meet on July 16 in Helsinki** to discuss a "range of national security issues," as well as "further development of Russian-American relations." Before the summit meeting was announced, Trump reported via Twitter that "Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!" He added: "Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at?" The Helsinki talks will follow a NATO meeting in Brussels on July 11 and 12. Trump told leaders at the recent G7 summit in Canada that "NATO is as bad as NAFTA," stoking fears that Trump plans to undercut the alliance's values and commitments.

3/ **Immigrant children as young as three are being ordered to appear in court for their own deportation hearings without legal representation.** The children are being served with notices to appear in court, but they are not entitled to an attorney. Instead, they are given a list of legal services organizations that might help them. Requiring unaccompanied minors to go through deportation alone is not new, but the number of children who are affected by this process has gone up during the Trump presidency.

4/ **Federal officials have launched two reviews into Trump's handling of families at the border.** The Government Accountability Office and the Health and Human Services inspector general both launched reviews.

6/ **Trump is considering Utah Senator Mike Lee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court**. Lee has publicly denounced Roe v. Wade. Mitch McConnell said Senate Republicans plan to hold a confirmation vote before November's midterms, when the party is at risk of losing its 51-to-49 majority. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-28/trump-is-said-to-weigh-senator-mike-lee-for-high-court-vacancy) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-plan-to-confirm-trumps-supreme-court-pick-before-the-november-elections/2018/06/27/9a9be6d6-7a34-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html))

* **Who's on Trump's short list to replace Supreme Court Justice Kennedy?** Trump will replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy with one of 25 people from a previously released list. "We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years," Trump said. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/anthony-kennedy-replacements-supreme-court-trump-679941) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-s-short-list-replace-kennedy-supreme-court-n887276))

* **The fate of the Supreme Court could hinge on Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski**. Republicans control the Senate by one seat and with Arizona Senator John McCain's absence the two moderate Republicans hold enormous sway over Trump's Supreme Court pick. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/28/susan-collins-lisa-murkowski-supreme-court-682316))
