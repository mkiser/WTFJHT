1/ **The Trump administration will rescind Obama-era guidelines that encourage college admissions to consider race as a factor in order to diversify their student bodies**. Trump administration officials contend the current policies "mislead schools to believe that legal forms of affirmative action are simpler to achieve than the law allows." The reversal would restore George W. Bush's policy that "strongly encourages the use of race-neutral methods" for student admissions. Jeff Sessions said Justice Department prosecutors will investigate and sue universities over discriminatory admissions policies. Schools that don't follow the new policy could also lose federal funding.

2/ **Leaked copies of Michael Cohen's shredded documents were reconstructed by the FBI and appear to confirm Cohen's $62,500 payment to a former Playboy model** on behalf of Republican fundraiser Elliot Broidy. The documents were seized during a raid by the FBI on Cohen's home and office in April and include handwritten notes about a taxi business, as well as insurance papers, correspondence from a woman described as a "vexatious litigant," who claims she is under government surveillance, and other documents that prosecutors already had in their possession.

3/ **Scott Pruitt and his aides kept "secret" calendars and schedules to hide controversial meetings and calls with industry representatives**. Staffers routinely met in Pruitt's office to "scrub" records from Pruitt's calendar because they might "look bad." "We would have meetings \[about\] what we were going to take off on the official schedule," said Pruitt's former deputy chief of staff Kevin Chmielewski. "We had at one point three different schedules. One of them was one that no one else saw except three or four of us. It was a secret ... and they would decide what to nix from the public calendar." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/politics/scott-pruitt-whistleblower-secret-calendar/index.html))

4/ **Two of Pruitt's top aides told congressional investigators that he leveraged his position for personal benefit and ignored warnings about potential ethical issues**. The staffers testified to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week, sharing details about Pruitt's spending and management decisions, his efforts to secure a six-figure job for his wife at a conservative political group, enlisting aides to perform personal tasks, and seeking high-end travel despite objections and warnings from staffers. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/pruitt-aides-reveal-new-details-of-his-spending-and-management-at-epa/2018/07/02/71b87384-7aec-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?utm_term=.170abe6c9b29))

5/ **Scott Pruitt asked Trump this spring to fire Jeff Sessions and let him run the Department of Justice**. Advisers shot down Pruitt's proposal to temporarily replace Sessions for 210 days under the Vacancies Reform Act, saying he would return to Oklahoma afterward to run for office. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/politics/scott-pruitt-jeff-sessions-trump/index.html))

6/ **ICE agents are forcing parents to choose between leaving the country with their children — or leaving the country without them**. The new instructions from the Trump administration to agents don't allow parents separated under the "zero tolerance" policy to reunite with their children while they await a decision on asylum – effectively preventing them from making an asylum claim. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/new-trump-admin-order-separated-parents-leave-u-s-kids-n888631))

7/ **A federal judge ordered the U.S. government to stop the blanket arrests of asylum seekers** and immediately release or grant hearings to more than 1,000 asylum seekers who have been jailed without individualized case reviews.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/us/politics/white-house-twitter-kamala-harris-elizabeth-warren.html))

8/ **Trump threatened several NATO allies in June that they increase defense spending and meet their security obligation or face consequences**. Trump hinted that one consequence could be an adjustment to the United States' military presence around the world. In his letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump warned that it would "become increasingly difficult to justify to American citizens why some countries do not share NATO's collective security burden while American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas or come home gravely wounded." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/world/europe/trump-nato.html))

* **NATO allies defend military spending amid Trump criticism**. NATO officials are concerned that trans-Atlantic divisions over trade tariffs and the U.S. pullout from the Paris global climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal could undermine alliance unity. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/nato-allies-defend-military-spending-amid-trump-criticism/2018/07/03/f965ea38-7ec9-11e8-a63f-7b5d2aba7ac5_story.html))

9/ **Trump ordered American flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor the victims of last week's shooting at the Capital Gazette newsroom**, after initially denying the request last week. Annapolis mayor, Gavin Buckley, submitted the flag request through Maryland representatives in Congress and was told Monday that it had been denied. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/us/capital-gazette-flags-half-staff.html))
