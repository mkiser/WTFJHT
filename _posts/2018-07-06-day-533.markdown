1/ **Trump mocked the #MeToo movement** in a speech in Montana on Thursday, repeatedly attacked Elizabeth Warren over her heritage, suggested Maxine Waters had an I.Q. in the "mid-60s," derided both John McCain and George H.W. Bush, and vouched for Putin. "You know what? Putin's fine," Trump told the crowd, referring to his upcoming meeting with the Russian leader. "He's fine. We're all fine. We're people. Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life."

* **Trump challenged Sen. Elizabeth Warren to take a DNA test to prove that she has Native American ancestors**, reviving his "Pocahontas" nickname for the Massachusetts Democrat, who has claimed Native American ancestry. Trump taunted Warren with an imaginary presidential debate, telling the crowd that he would toss her a DNA kit, "but we have to do it gently because we're in the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very gentle." He made a throwing motion and said: "We will very gently take that kit, and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm."
