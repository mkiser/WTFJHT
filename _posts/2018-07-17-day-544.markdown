1/ **Trump backtracked and tried to spin his Helsinki summit comments**. Reading from prepared remarks, Trump claimed he misspoke yesterday and meant to say "I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia" that interfered in the election. Trump also said "I accept" the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but it "could be other people also." Trump asserted that "Russia's actions had no impact at all" on the election outcome. During yesterday's news conference, Trump said he doesn't "see any reason" why Russia would have meddled during the last election. Prior to that, Trump blamed the U.S. for acting with "foolishness and stupidity" toward Russia in the past. Trump also rejected the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Instead, Trump said he believed Putin's denial.

* **The top voting machine maker admitted to installing remote-access software on election-management systems from 2000 to 2006 it sold in the U.S.** In a letter sent to Sen. Ron Wyden in April 2018, Election Systems and Software admitted that it had "provided pcAnywhere remote connection software … to a small number of customers between 2000 and 2006." The statement contradicts previous claims by the company in February that "none of the employees, … including long-tenured employees, has any knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with remote-access software."

* **Protests erupted outside the White House as Trump returned from Helsinki, with dozens of demonstrators chanting "Traitor! Traitor!"** until late into the night.

3/ **Obama on Trump: "Those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning."** Obama, delivering the 2018 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg, warned that "strongman politics are ascending suddenly, whereby elections, some pretense of democracy, are maintained, the form of it."

* \[Speculation\] **Several legal experts think Manafort could be cutting a plea deal** after the judge overseeing the federal court case delayed a hearing to discuss postponing the trial and moving the venue. According to court documents, no party had submitted a request for such a delay.
