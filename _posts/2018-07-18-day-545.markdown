1/ **Trump said "no," he does not believe Russia is still targeting the U.S. with efforts to undermine American democracy, contradicting his director of national intelligence**. [Last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/07/16/day-543/#4-trump-called-robert-muellers-probe), Dan Coats said that "the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack." And, in particular, Russia is the "most aggressive foreign actor, no question. And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy." Coats described Russia as one of the "worst offenders." Sarah Sanders said the Russian "threat still exists" and that Trump was saying "no" to answering more questions. Intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K. also believe Russia is planning to ramp up digital operations targeting western countries now that the World Cup and the Trump-Putin Helsinki summit have ended.

* **Trump claimed he told Putin "we can't have meddling" when they met** and that he believes it's "true" that Russia tampered with the 2016 presidential election and that he "would" hold Putin personally responsible for future interference. *\[Editor's note: I bet.\]* ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-on-whether-he-holds-putin-responsible-i-would-because-hes-in-charge-of-the-country/))

2/ **Trump defended his summit with Putin, tweeting that "people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki."** The claim comes less than 24 hours after Trump attempted to [backtrack and spin](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/07/17/day-544/#1-trump-backtracked-and-tried-to-spi) his statements that he mispoke and meant to say "I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia" that interfered in the election. Trump promised "big results" and "many positive things." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-returns-to-touting-his-summit-with-putin-a-day-after-doing-damage-control/2018/07/18/ff794dea-8a70-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?utm_term=.0c7718f29e9b) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/politics/trump-putin-higher-intelligence.html))

* **Trump crossed out a line about bringing those responsible for election hacking to justice in his statement correcting his remarks during his press conference with Putin.** Trump prepared four pages of handwritten notes for his meeting with congressional leaders yesterday, part of which read "I have on numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. A̶n̶y̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶i̶n̶v̶o̶l̶v̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶m̶e̶d̶d̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶i̶c̶e̶." Trump used a black marker to cross out the part about bringing the hackers to justice. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/17/in-his-prepared-remarks-trump-removed-a-line-about-bringing-election-hackers-to-justice/?utm_term=.ddbc4e9a4992))

* **European newspapers described Trump as "weak," a "poodle," and a "stooge"** following his summit with Putin. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/european-press-mocks-trump-weak-putins-poodle-summit/story?id=56641842))

* **Putin also claimed he misspoke about his claim that Hillary Clinton’s campaign had received $400 million in donations from investors accused of tax evasion in Russia**. According to the Russian government, Putin "meant" to say that U.S.-born investor William Browder had donated $400,000 to Clinton’s campaign, which also appears to be inflated. ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/07/18/putin-says-misspoke-withdrawing-claim-clinton-got-millions-stolen-russia/))

3/ **The woman charged with secretly acting as a Russian intelligence official offered "sex in exchange" for influence** at "a special interest organization" the FBI referred to as a "gun rights organization." Prosecutors argue that Butina "engaged in a yearslong conspiracy to work covertly in the U.S. as an undeclared agent of the Russian federation to advance the interests of her home country." Her actions are believed to have been directed by Alexander Torshin, one of Putin's closest allies, who the U.S. sanctioned in April. Butina and Torshin were also frequent attendees at NRA conventions. Butina is believed to have "cohabited and been involved in a personal relationship" with an unnamed U.S. person for the purpose of developing an influence operation. Her partner is believed to be Paul Erickson, a conservative activist and NRA member from South Dakota.

* **A federal magistrate judge ordered that Maria Butina must be jailed ahead of her trial after prosecutors argued she was "an extreme risk of flight"** and should be held without bond during her appearance in federal court. Prosecutors said she was ready to move out out of the country, had her boxes packed, terminated her lease, and wired money from her bank account back to Russia. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/18/630094267/maria-butina-was-in-contact-with-russian-intelligence-feds-say-in-new-documents) / [New York Times](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/88-maria-butina-detention-motion/c4e3c01d65cac059a4fc/optimized/full.pdf#page=1))

* **The Justice Department added a second charge against Russian national Maria Butina of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of the Kremlin** since at least 2015. Butina was charged on Monday with [conspiracy to act as an agent](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/07/16/day-543/#5-the-justice-department-charged-a-r) of a foreign government. Butina was arrested on Sunday because she appeared to have plans to flee the U.S. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/17/russia-nra-foreign-agent-728305) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/alleged-russian-agent-maria-butina-had-ties-to-russian-intelligence-agency-prosecutors-say/2018/07/18/a1a4042c-8a01-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html))

4/ **Democrats want the interpreter from Trump's private meeting with Putin to testify before Congress.** "I'm calling for a hearing with the U.S. interpreter who was present during President Trump's meeting with Putin to uncover what they discussed privately," Sen. Jeanne Shaheen tweeted. Rep. Joe Kennedy echoed Shaheen's calls: "And that was only what we saw on live TV. @realDonaldTrump's translator should come before Congress and testify as to what was said privately immediately." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/politics/trump-interpreter-testify-congress/index.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-hearing-interpreter-trump-putin_us_5b4e4d86e4b0de86f487a4e3))

5/ **Trump questioned why NATO should come to the defense of smaller alliance members like Montenegro if it came under attack.** "Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people," Trump said when asked whether the U.S. would come to the country's defense. "They're very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations you're in World War III." The only time [NATO invoked Article Five](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/after-attacks-alliance-for-first-time-nato-invokes-joint-defense-pact-with-us.html) – an "armed attack" on one member "shall be considered an attack against them all" – was after the U.S. was attacked on 9/11. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-calls-out-very-aggressive-montenegro-latest-nato-jibe-n892311) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/politics/trump-nato-fox/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-defending-tiny-nato-ally-montenegro-could-lead-to-world-war-iii/2018/07/18/f7a09276-8a80-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html))
