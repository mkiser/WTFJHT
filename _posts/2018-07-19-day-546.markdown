1/ **Two weeks before his inauguration, Trump was briefed that Putin had personally ordered the cyberattacks to influence the 2016 election**. The intelligence briefing included texts and emails from Russian military officers, as well as evidence from a source close to Putin, who had described how the Kremlin executed the hacking and disinformation campaign. After flip-flopping on whether he believed Putin's denial that Russia interfered in the election, Trump indirectly blamed Putin for meddling, "because he's in charge of the country." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html))

* **A Senate Republican blocked passage of a non-binding, bipartisan resolution backing the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election**. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn called the resolution "purely a symbolic act," sinking the effort to pass the resolution by unanimous consent.

2/ **Trump now "disagrees" with Putin's "incredible offer" to allow Moscow to interrogate 11 Americans in exchange for access to the 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted for their role in trying to sabotage the 2016 election**, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders. [Yesterday](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/18/trump-russia-browder-mcfaul-questioning-731616), the White House said Trump was entertaining Putin's proposal to swap officials for questioning, calling it "an interesting idea," which prompted a [backlash](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-condemn-white-house-suggestion-kremlin-interrogate-us/story?id=56687264) from both Republicans and Democrats. It took Trump three days to come this conclusion. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-to-vote-on-urging-trump-to-reject-putins-request-to-interrogate-mcfaul/2018/07/19/db133978-8b71-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/politics/trump-putin-browder-mcfaul.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-interviews/white-house-rejects-putin-proposal-to-interview-u-s-citizens-idUSKBN1K92PP))

3/ **Russia's ambassador to the U.S. claimed Trump and Putin had reached several "important verbal agreements"** on issues in the Middle East and nuclear proliferation. Senior U.S. military leaders, however, have little to no information about what the two leaders discussed or agreed to.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders then tweeted that Trump had asked National Security Adviser John Bolton to invite Putin, adding, the "discussions are already underway."

6/ **FBI Director Christopher Wray: Russia is the "most aggressive actor" in election interference** and is "very active" at "sowing discord and divisiveness in this country." Wray added: "My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/18/politics/wray-russia-meddling-contrast-trump/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-director-wray-hints-he-considered-resigning-restates-belief-russian-n892631) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/397769-fbi-director-says-russian-influence-efforts-are-very-active))

* **Sean Spicer contradicted Trump's claim that the Robert Mueller investigation is a witch hunt**, saying that "I see no evidence that it is" and that "I think it's very important to be clear that Russia meddled in our election and there's no evidence of collusion."

* **Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed she hasn't "seen evidence" that Russia tried to swing the 2016 election** in Trump's favor.

7/ **New York State is investigating whether the Trump Foundation violated state tax laws**. The investigation by the Department of Taxation and Finance will focus on some of the same issues as the New York attorney general's lawsuit: campaign finance violations, self-dealing, and illegal coordination with the Trump campaign. If the investigation finds possible criminal activity, it could refer the findings to the state attorney general or to a district attorney. Trump's tax returns could possibly be revealed as part of a criminal investigation.
