1/ **Trump's national security team said Russia is behind "pervasive" and "ongoing" attempts to interfere in upcoming U.S. elections**. "The threat is real. It is continuing," said Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence. Hours later, Trump defended his "great meeting with Putin," saying "the Russian hoax" is getting in the way of improved relations with the world's second-ranked nuclear power. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-security/u-s-cites-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-weaken-election-idUSKBN1KN2KQ) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/national-security-leaders-warn-of-pervasive-threats-to-us-elections.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-pennsylvania-rally/index.html))

* **The Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian bank**, two North Korean entities and one North Korean citizen for facilitating "illegal financial activity." The Russian-registered AgrosoyuzCommercial Bank was sanctioned for doing business with a North Korean who was the "Moscow-based chief representative of Foreign Trade Bank, North Korea's primary foreign exchange bank." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/trump-administration-sanctions-russian-bank-for-north-korea-ties.html))

2/ **The NRA is in financial jeopardy and may "be unable to exist ... or pursue its advocacy mission."** Since May, the gun group has been suing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state's financial regulators, claiming the state of New York subjected it to a "blacklisting campaign" that resulted in "tens of millions of dollars in damages" from the loss of insurance coverage it needs in order to "maintain its physical premises, convene off-site meetings and events, operate educational programs," and "hold rallies, conventions, and assemblies." The association overspent by almost $46 million in 2016. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/nra-financial-trouble-706371/))

* ✊ **The "National March on the NRA" rally will begin at noon on Saturday in front of the association's Virginia headquarters**. It is expected to last three hours. ([National March on NRA](https://www.marchonnra.org/info))

3/ **China will impose retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports if Trump goes ahead with his latest threat to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods**. The Trump administration imposed 25% duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods on July 6, which prompted Beijing to retaliate with similar charges on the same amount of U.S. products. A senior administration official said there was "zero" engagement between the Trump administration and China. Another official said there has been "one call in the past few days," and that it resolved nothing.

4/ **A Trump donor agreed to pay Michael Cohen $10 million if he could secure a $5 billion loan from the federal government for a nuclear power plant in Alabama**. The loan application by Franklin Haney's company is still pending at the Energy Department. The agreement, which is no longer in effect, was made shortly before Cohen's home, office and hotel room were raided by federal agents on April 9. Haney donated $1 million to the Trump inaugural fund through a corporate entity. Nuclear Development LLC and Franklin L. Haney Co., have spent nearly $1.1 million since the end of 2016 lobbying the federal government and Congress on issues related to nuclear power.  ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-trump-donor-agreed-to-pay-michael-cohen-10-million-for-nuclear-project-push-sources-say-1533245330) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/trump-donor-agreed-to-pay-michael-cohen-10-million-in-consulting-deal.html))

5/ **The judge overseeing the reunification of the 2,551 migrant children separated from their parents called the Trump administration's lack of a plan "unacceptable at this point."** 572 children remain in government custody and the parents of 410 children are currently outside the U.S. They've likely been deported. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-calls-trump-administration-family-reunification-efforts-unacceptable-n897531))

6/ **Revenue at the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan was up 13% in the first three months of 2018 thanks to "a last-minute visit" by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia**. The Crown Prince, however, didn't stay at the hotel, because the suites weren't big enough to accommodate his family. However, "due to our close industry relationships," the hotel's general manager wrote, "we were able to accommodate many of the accompanying travelers." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-president-trumps-hotel-in-new-york-revenue-went-up-this-spring--thanks-to-a-visit-from-big-spending-saudis/2018/08/03/58755392-9112-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html))
