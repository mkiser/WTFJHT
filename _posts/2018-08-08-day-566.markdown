1/ **Trump's legal team rejected Robert Mueller's request for a voluntary presidential interview, saying questions about possible obstruction of justice are legally inappropriate**. Trump's lawyers instead offered an "avenue" of a narrower set of questions that they'd accept. Both Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow declined to describe the details of their counteroffer other than "it is a good faith attempt to reach an agreement." According to Giuliani, it's ultimately "his decision" – Trump's – as to whether or not to grant Mueller an interview. Giuliani added that "this should be over by September 1," because "we do not want to run into the November elections."

3/ **The Trump administration will sanction Russia for its use of a chemical weapon against a former Russian spy living in England**.

4/ **Putin lobbied Trump on nuclear arms control, banning weapons in space, and several other issues during their private two-hour meeting in Helsinki last month**, according to a leaked Russian document. Putin shared the document of proposed topics for negotiation with Trump during their two-hour conversation, which Trump's top advisers were not privy to at the time. Among the priorities, Putin wanted to extend an Obama-era nuclear-reduction treaty to ensure the "non-placement of weapons in space," which would hamper Trump's ability of establishing a Space Force.

Paul said he was "honored" to share the letter from Trump, which "emphasized the importance of further engagement in various areas including countering terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming cultural exchange." Rand also said members of the Russian Federation agreed to visit Washington at his invitation despite the White House recently announcing that Trump would delay any meeting with Putin until the Russia investigation concludes.

VA officials have also travelled to Mar-a-Lago at taxpayer expense to hear their views. As one former administration official said: "Everyone has to go down and kiss the ring."
