1/ **The FBI fired Peter Strzok for violating bureau policies**. Strzok is the FBI senior counterintelligence agent who sent text messages critical of Trump to a former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. Strzok helped lead the bureau's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election until officials discovered his text messages. FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered Strzok fired even though the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility concluded he should be suspended for 60 days and demoted.

3/ **Omarosa Manigault Newman secretly taped John Kelly firing her in December in the Situation Room**, as well as a phone call she had with Trump after she was fired. On the recording, Kelly suggests that she could be facing "pretty significant legal issues" and that he wants to "see this be a friendly departure" so it doesn't "develop into something that, that'll make it ugly for you." On the second recording, Trump asks: "Omarosa what's going on? I just saw on the news that you're thinking about leaving?" He added: "Nobody even told me about it... I didn't know that. Goddamn it. I don't love you leaving at all." Trump called Omarosa "wacky" and "vicious," and claimed that Kelly called her a "loser" and "nothing but problems" in a series of tweets following the release of the tapes.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/us/politics/trump-nondisclosure-agreement.html))
