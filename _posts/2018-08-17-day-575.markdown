1/ **Advisers are worried that Trump will back Erik Prince's plan to privatize the war in Afghanistan with Blackwater security contractors**. Trump's national security team are concerned that his impatience will cause him to seriously consider proposals like Prince's or abruptly order a complete U.S. withdrawal. Prince hasn't spoken directly to Trump about the plan, but plans to launch an aggressive media "air campaign" in coming days. Prince's sister is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

2/ **Trump canceled his military parade and blamed "the local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly)" for inflating the cost**. "When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade," Trump tweeted, "they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!" The Pentagon postponed Trump's parade to 2019  yesterday – before Trump "decided" to cancel it via tweet this morning – as the costs ballooned from an estimated $12 million to $92 million. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump's parade a "sad" plan.

3/ **Trump plans to revoke more security clearances from officials who have been critical of him or played a role in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.** Over the past 19 months, Trump has fired or threatened nearly a dozen current and former officials associated with the probe, which he calls a "rigged witch hunt." According to his aides, Trump believes he came out looking strong after he revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance, adding that Trump shows visible disdain for Brennan when he sees him on TV. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-gears-up-to-strip-more-clearances-from-officials-tied-to-russia-probe/2018/08/16/341fe418-a165-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.b2bca5e3e978))

4/ **Trump called a career Justice Department official "a disgrace" and threatened to revoke his security clearance "very soon."** Bruce Ohr has no involvement in Mueller's investigation, but conspiracy theorists claim he helped start the investigation into Russian election interference. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-bruce-nellie-ohr.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-intelligence-officials-rebuke-trump-for-pulling-brennans-security-clearance/2018/08/17/ea8382f2-a20d-11e8-8e87-c869fe70a721_story.html))

* **A dozen former top intelligence officials accused Trump of "attempt\[ing\] to stifle free speech"** and criticized him for revoking John Brennan's security clearance. "We feel compelled to respond in the wake of the ill-considered and unprecedented remarks and actions by the White House," reads the letter from the officials, who served both Democratic and Republican presidents. Trump told reporters he's gotten a "tremendous response" since revoking Brennan's clearance.

5/ **Trump called Paul Manafort a "very good person" as jurors deliberate charges of tax and bank fraud against his former campaign chairman**. Trump criticized the trial as "a very sad day for our country," but declined to say whether he would pardon Manafort if convicted. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-17/trump-calls-manafort-good-person-and-criticizes-fraud-trial) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/17/paul-manafort-trial-trump-pardon-783133) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/jury-begins-deliberations-in-paul-manaforts-tax--and-bank-fraud-trial/2018/08/16/d2b0f486-a170-11e8-8e87-c869fe70a721_story.html))

* **The judge presiding over Paul Manafort's criminal trial has received threats about the case is now under U.S. Marshal protection**. Judge T.S. Ellis said he won't release the names and addresses of the 12 jurors deliberating Manafort's fate because he is worried about their "peace and safety." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/17/judge-in-paul-manafort-trial-said-hes-been-threatened.html))

6/ **A judge in New York ruled that a confidentiality agreement between the Trump campaign and a former staffer is limited in scope**, which could impact other non-disclosure agreements signed by former Trump staffers. Due to the wording of the agreement, only disputes over the agreement itself and some other prohibited behaviors were subject to arbitration. A former campaign staffer filed a complaint last November alleging that she was subjected to "harassment and sexual discrimination" while working on Trump's 2016 campaign. Lawyers for the Trump campaign tried to force the case into private arbitration based on the agreement.
