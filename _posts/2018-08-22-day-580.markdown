1/ **Michael Cohen has "knowledge" implicating Trump in a "criminal conspiracy" to hack the Democratic emails during the 2016 election**, according to Cohen's attorney. Lanny Davis also said Cohen's knowledge reached beyond "the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude" and is willing to share "all that he knows" with Robert Mueller's team.

* **Cohen's lawyer said his client would never accept pardon from "corrupt" Trump** because he "is not interested in being dirtied" or bailed out like Trump's "political cronies."

2/ **Trump's real estate company approved $420,000 in "election-related" expenses to Michael Cohen for his effort to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal** during the presidential campaign. The documents show an unnamed Trump Organization executive instructing an employee to describe the payments to Cohen as legal expenses "for services rendered for the year 2017." Prosecutors say  "the invoices were a sham," and Cohen's own disclosures filed with the Office of Government Ethics report that he had incurred "election-related" expenses in 2016 just before the election, and that Trump fully reimbursed him in 2017. Cohen's reimbursements included the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, other fees and taxes – and a $60,000 bonus.

3/ **In a pair of tweets, Trump attacked Michael Cohen and then praised Paul Manafort for refusing "break" or "make up stories in order to get a 'deal."** Manafort was convicted of tax and financial fraud yesterday. Cohen, meanwhile, pleaded guilty yesterday to eight criminal charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations, and told prosecutors he acted at the direction of Trump. Without offering any evidence, Trump claimed that the campaign finance violations were "not a crime." At the same time, Trump said he had "such respect" and feels "very badly" for Manafort, calling him "brave man!" for not cooperating with federal authorities. Trump capped off his Twitter tirade by taking a shot at Cohen: "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!"

* **Trump didn't mention Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen once during his rally in West Virginia last night.** Instead, Trump egged on his supporters in the Charleston crowd as they chanted "drain the swamp" and "lock her up." He also reminded the crowd how smart they are. "We’re the smart ones," Trump said at the rally. "Remember, I say it all the time: you hear, 'the elite,' you’re smarter than they are, you have more money than they do...let them have the word elite. You’re the super-elite." Trump also spent a few minutes going after Mueller and calling his investigation a witch hunt.
