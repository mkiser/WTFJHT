1/ **The chief financial officer at the Trump Organization was given immunity by federal prosecutors in New York in exchange for information about Michael Cohen** as part of their criminal investigation into hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign. Allen Weisselberg, who is identified in court filings as "Executive-1," helped authorize $420,000 in reimbursements to Cohen and was granted immunity in exchange for his grand jury testimony about his role in the payments last month. According to prosecutors, Cohen – then Trump's attorney – sent an invoice to Weisselberg in January 2017 for "Payment for services rendered for the month of January and February, 2017," which reflected Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels in October 2016, as well as an additional $50,000 for "tech services." Weisselberg directed another Trump Organization executive to "pay from the Trust" and to "post to legal expenses." Executives at the Trump Organization "'grossed up' for tax purposes" the reimbursement, doubling the invoice to $360,000, adding a $60,000 bonus. After he was elected, Trump handed over control of his financial assets and business interests to Eric and Trump Jr., and Weisselberg.

2/ **The Manhattan district attorney's office is considering criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior company officials in connection with Cohen's hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels.** The state's investigation would focus on whether the Trump Organization violated state tax law for listing Cohen's reimbursement as a legal expense. Federal prosecutors have said the payments were based on "sham" legal invoices in connection with a nonexistent retainer agreement, and that Cohen did no legal work in connection with the matter. The New York State attorney general's office is seeking a referral from the state Department of Taxation and Finance, which is needed to conduct the inquiry and to prosecute any violations of state tax law.

3/ **After Jeff Sessions said he would not be influence by politics, Trump tweeted that Sessions must "look into all of the corruption on the 'other side,'"** adding: "Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!" On Thursday, Trump criticized Sessions in a Fox News interview for failing to control the Justice Department, after which Sessions said the Department of Justice "will not be improperly influenced by political considerations." Trump mocked Sessions' response, tweeting, "Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants." In particular, Trump wants Sessions to investigate "deleted Emails, Comey lies and leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele and his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more." Nearly all which Sessions has recused himself from.

* **"Moves are being made" to remove Sessions after the midterm elections**, according to Sen. Bob Corker. "It's apparent that after the midterms, \[Trump\] will make a change and choose someone to do what he wants done."

## Notables.

1. **Trump told the Italian prime minister that he is ready to help fund the country's public debt next year by buying Italian government bonds.** Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told officials about Trump's offer after attending a meeting in Washington about three weeks ago. Conte didn't give any additional details about the plan or say whether he believes it would work.

2. **Blackwater founder Erik Prince is once again trying to convince Trump to let him privatize the war in Afghanistan.** Prince hasn't spoken with Trump recently, but he has been making the rounds in the media and talking up his plan to replace U.S. and coalition forces with private contractors. Very few defense officials think Prince's plan will work, but some are concerned that Trump might entertain the idea. "We have to take this seriously because the commander-in-chief might take it seriously," said author and former mercenary Sean McFate, "and if the only logic is that everything else we have tried has failed so anything can work in the future, that’s an absurd logic." Prince is the brother of Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/403146-faced-with-opposition-erik-prince-shops-his-plan-for-afghanistan))

3. **The former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who in 2017 leaked a top-secret government report on Russian hacking efforts to The Intercept was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison.** Reality Winner pleaded guilty in June, and is the first person to be sentenced under the Espionage Act since Trump became president. She received the longest sentence ever imposed by a federal court for the unauthorized released of classified information to the media. Trump tweeted about Winner's sentence, comparing her actions to Hillary Clinton's. "Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over ‘classified’ information," Trump tweeted. "Gee, this is ‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard."
