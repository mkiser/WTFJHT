1/ **The U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement to end the North American Free Trade Agreement and replace it with the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement**. Trump called the new name for the trade deal "elegant," because the NAFTA name had "a bad connotation" and was a job-killing "disaster" for the U.S. The preliminary agreement excludes Canada, as Trump has repeatedly criticized the country's trade practices. Canadian leaders have insisted they will not sign a deal that does not work in their favor. The preliminary deal will last for 16 years and be reviewed every six years.

2/ **A former doorman at Trump World Tower is now free to discuss "information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child"** – the one he fathered with an ex-housekeeper in the late 1980s. Dino Sajudin entered into a "source agreement" with American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, on Nov. 15, 2015, but he was "recently" released from the contract, according to his attorney. In April, Sajudin [said](https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/12/media/trump-national-enquirer-doorman/index.html) he had previously been "instructed not to criticize President Trump's former housekeeper due to a prior relationship she had with President Trump which produced a child." At the time, AMI called Sajudin's story "not credible."

3/ **Trump refused to approve a White House statement honoring John McCain's military service, which called McCain a "hero."** Sarah Huckabee Sanders, John Kelly, and other White House staffers advocated for a statement lauding McCain's career, but Trump told them he wanted to tweet instead. Shortly after McCain's death was announced, Trump tweeted: "My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!" Trump is [not invited](https://www.axios.com/mccain-doesnt-want-trump-at-his-funeral-67f24b4a-4244-49b8-8713-acfaa3052611.html) to the late senator's funeral.

* **John McCain died on August 25**. He was 81.

4/ **A federal judge struck down most of Trump's executive orders limiting the power of federal employee unions**. In May, Trump signed three executive orders which made it easier for managers to fire under-performing federal employees and limited the issues that could be bargained over in union negotiations. In her decision, the judge wrote that the president cannot "eviscerate the right to bargain collectively as envisioned" in the federal labor-management relations statute. She added: "The collective bargaining process is not a cutthroat death match."

5/ **Trump added a blue stripe to the American flag during a flag-coloring session at a children's hospital in Ohio**. The stripes on the U.S. flag are red and white; the blue is the background to flag's stars. *Editor's note:* 🇷🇺 *or* 🇫🇷\*?\* ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-us-flag-wrong-colour-blue-stripe-a8508556.html) / [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/photo-donald-trump-coloring-american-flag-wrong-going-viral-183549669.html))

## Notables.

1. **The federal official in charge of protecting student borrowers from predatory lending practices resigned**, saying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the White House have " turned its back on young people and their financial futures."

4. **A government watchdog group has found a discrepancy between Trump's financial disclosures and the payments he made to Michael Cohen.** Trump's financial disclosure form states that he "fully reimbursed" Cohen between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2017, but court documents filed by federal prosecutors state that Cohen received $420,000 from the Trump Organization over the course of that year. "It is quite notable," said Scott Amey, general counsel of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. "This may constitute a false statement by the president. If they were paying him $420 \[thousand\] they should have put the whole amount in there." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/trump-paid-michael-cohen-more-than-what-he-stated-in-financial-disclosure.html))

7. **Trump met with a QAnon conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office last week**, according to photos posted on the man's Twitter account. Michael Lebron, known as Lionel in online circles, is described on his own websites as "an avowed conspiracy analyst." Photos posted to Lionel's Twitter account show him with Trump in the Oval Office and touring the White House. "There are simply no words to explicate the profound and ineffable honor of meeting @realDonaldTrump in the tabernacle of liberty, the Oval Office," Lionel tweeted.
