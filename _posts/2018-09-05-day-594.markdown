1/ **A senior Trump administration official published an anonymous essay in the New York Times claiming cabinet members discussed removing Trump from office early in his presidency "given the instability many witnessed."** The official criticized Trump's "amorality" and reckless decision-making, saying "there is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first" and that "Americans should know that there are adults in the room" who "fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won't.

2/ **Trump called the unsigned op-ed a "disgrace" and "gutless."** Trump attacked the New York Times for publishing an essay by an unnamed administration official who claims the president's advisers deliberately try to prevent Trump's misguided impulses. The anonymous official wrote that Trump's "impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic." At a White House event, Trump addressed the op-ed, saying "This is what we have to deal with." He added: "They don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them." Trump later tweeted "TREASON?" and then demanded that "the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"
