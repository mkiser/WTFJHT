1/ **Trump suggested that protesting should be illegal** after Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing was disrupted by protesters. Trump called it "embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don't even know what side the protesters are on."  ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-suggests-protesting-should-be-illegal/2018/09/04/11cfd9be-b0a0-11e8-aed9-001309990777_story.html?utm_term=.e8e4b1136452))

2/ **Trump called for NBC to lose its broadcast license**, tweeting "I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?"

3/ **Robert Mueller's office agreed to accept some written answers from Trump**, according to a letter from the special counsels office to Trump's lawyers.

4/ **Trump is "in the worst mood of his presidency"** and is frequently calling confidants to "vent about his selection of \[Jeff\] Sessions and \[FBI Director Christopher\] Wray." Trump is criticizing Wray and painting him as another Justice Department official who refuses to protect his interests and is possibly out to undermine his presidency.
