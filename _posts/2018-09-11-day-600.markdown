1/ **Trump began the 17th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks by tweeting a defense of himself in the Russia investigation** while also attacking the FBI. In a string of tweets that appeared to quote from a segment on Fox News, Trump blamed FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page for employing a "media leak strategy" to undermine his administration. He then blamed the FBI and Justice Department for doing "NOTHING" about it. Almost two hours later, Trump tweeted: "17 years since September 11th!"

* **Trump bragged that one of his buildings was now the tallest in downtown Manhattan hours after the World Trade Center collapsed** in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. "40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest," Trump said during a telephone interview on the afternoon of Sept. 11 with local New Jersey television station WWOR. "And then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it’s the tallest."
