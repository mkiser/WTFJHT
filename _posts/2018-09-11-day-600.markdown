1/ **Trump began the 17th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks by tweeting a defense of himself in the Russia investigation** while also attacking the FBI. In a string of tweets that appeared to quote from a segment on Fox News, Trump blamed FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page for employing a "media leak strategy" to undermine his administration. He then blamed the FBI and Justice Department for doing "NOTHING" about it. Almost two hours later, Trump tweeted: "17 years since September 11th!"

* **A history of Trump's comments about 9/11**. For instance, in November 2015 he claimed, without evidence, that "thousands and thousands" of Muslims in New Jersey had celebrated the news of the attacks.

* **Trump bragged that one of his buildings was now the tallest in downtown Manhattan hours after the World Trade Center collapsed** in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. "40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest," Trump said during a telephone interview on the afternoon of Sept. 11 with local New Jersey television station WWOR. "And then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it’s the tallest."

2/ **The Trump administration plans to make it easier for energy companies to release methane into the atmosphere.** The EPA plans to weaken an Obama-era requirement that companies monitor and repair methane leaks, while the Interior Department wants to repeal a restriction on intentional venting and burning of methane by drilling operations. Methane is among the most potent greenhouse gases and is roughly 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere.

3/ **The number of White House aides Trump trusts is "much smaller"** following allegations that there is a "resistance" inside the Trump administration trying to subvert his agenda. Trump Jr. said he believes the New York Times op-ed authored by an anonymous senior administration official was written by a "low-level person," and that the Justice Department should investigate the author. He called the op-ed "pretty disgusting" and "sad."

4/ **Trump said his administration is "totally prepared" for Hurricane Florence**, which he described as "tremendously big and tremendously wet" with "tremendous amounts of water." Trump called the federal government's "incredibly successful" response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico a year ago "one of the best jobs that's ever been done." Nearly 3,000 people died. Meanwhile, the general who oversaw the military response to Hurricane Katrina, said "I will not bet any money that we are prepared."
