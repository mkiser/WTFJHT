1/ **The Department of Homeland Security diverted nearly $10 million from FEMA to help ICE pay for detention and removal operations.** A newly released budget document shows DHS diverted the funds from FEMA at the beginning of the hurricane season, which began in June. The money was taken out of FEMA's operations and support budget and was transferred into ICE accounts to pay for additional detention camps and other expenses. FEMA said the monet was not meant for disaster relief and that the $10 million represents an extremely small portion of what is actually being spent on hurricane recovery. A spokesperson for DHS also pushed back on Twitter: "Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster."

2/ **Trump called the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico "totally incompetent"** after Yulin Cruz criticized Trump's statements about his response to the hurricanes that ravaged Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico last year. Trump tweeted: "We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan). We are ready for the big one that is coming!" ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-calls-san-juan-mayor-totally-incompetent/story?id=57767633))

3/ **Trump signed an executive order authorizing a broad range of sanctions against foreign countries, companies and individuals that interfere with U.S. elections.** The determination as to whether election interference occurred will be based on findings from U.S. intelligence agencies. The order tasks a range of intelligence agencies with determining if meddling occurred, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, the NSA, and the Department of Homeland Security. It requires any federal agency aware of election interference by foreign entities to submit the information to the Director of National Intelligence for review.

* **Three-quarters of the secret money spent in recent elections came from just 15 groups.** An analysis by the campaign-finance reform group Issue One found that many of these same 15 groups remain big players in the 2018 midterm elections, although the sources of their money remain mostly hidden from the public.

4/ **Investigators are looking into a pair of suspicious money transfers involving people who attended the 2016 Trump Tower meeting.** The transfers reveal how Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire with strong ties to both Trump and Putin, used overseas accounts to distribute money to himself, his son, and at least two people who attended the Trump Tower meeting. Investigators are focusing on two bursts of transactions: one shortly before the Trump Tower meeting and one immediately after Trump won the 2016 election.
