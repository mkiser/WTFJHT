1/ **Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions against foreign countries, companies, and individuals interfering with U.S. elections**, as determined by U.S. intelligence agencies. The order tasks a range of agencies—including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, the NSA, and the Department of Homeland Security—with evaluating potential cases of election meddling and requires any federal agency aware of interference to submit this information to the Director of National Intelligence.

* **Three-quarters of the secret money spent in recent elections came from just 15 groups.** An analysis by the campaign-finance reform group Issue One found that many of these same 15 groups remain big players in the 2018 midterm elections, although the sources of their money remain mostly hidden from the public.

2/ **The Department of Homeland Security diverted nearly $10 million from FEMA to help ICE pay for detention and removal operations.** A newly released budget document shows DHS transferred the funds—at the beginning of hurricane season—from FEMA's operations and support budget to ICE accounts to pay for detention camps and other expenses. FEMA said the money was not meant for disaster relief. A spokesperson for DHS called reporting on the budget document "a sorry attempt to push a false agenda."

3/ **Trump called San Juan's mayor "totally incompetent"** in response to her critique of Trump, who had recently boasted of federal responses to the hurricanes that ravaged Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico last year. Carmen Yulín Cruz had taken issue with him calling the response to Hurricane Maria "an unsung success." Trump also called Puerto Rico "an inaccessible island with very poor electricity."

4/ **Federal investigators are looking into a series of suspicious financial transactions involving people who attended the 2016 Trump Tower meeting.** The transfers reveal how Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire with strong ties to Trump and Putin, used overseas accounts to distribute money through a web of banks to himself, his son, and at least two people who attended the meeting. Investigators are focusing on two bursts of activity: one occurring shortly before the Trump Tower meeting and one immediately after the 2016 election.

5/ **Scott Pruitt is in talks to consult for a Kentucky coal-mining tycoon**, months after resigning as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt met with Alliance Resource Partners CEO Joseph W. Craft at least seven times in the first 14 months of his tenure as EPA chief. Under an ethics pledge, Pruitt is barred from directly lobbying the EPA for five years—but not from working as a private consultant who advises on matters related to the EPA or works to change regulatory policy at the state level.
