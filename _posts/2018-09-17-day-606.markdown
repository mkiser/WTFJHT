1/ **The author of the letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct came forward to tell her story.** Christine Blasey Ford is a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California who alleges Kavanaugh and a friend sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s. "I thought he might inadvertently kill me," Ford said. "He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing." Ford said she felt a "civic responsibility" to speak out about the Supreme Court nominee.

2/ **Sen. Jeff Flake wants to delay the vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation until Ford has a chance to testify** in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Flake is part of the GOP's one-vote majority on the committee. "For me," Flake said, "we can't vote until we hear more."

3/ **Trump's tax cuts have resulted in the repatriation of only 3.5 percent of the cash he predicted they would bring back to the United States.** By ending the practice of taxing U.S. companies when they brought home foreign profits, Trump said, "Over $4 [trillion], but close to $5 trillion, will be brought back into our country." The latest analysis shows $143 billion has been repatriated. Two-thirds of the profits are from two companies: networking giant Cisco Systems and a drug company called Gilead Sciences.

4/ **Ted Cruz's Senatorial campaign sent out hundreds of thousands of donation mailers disguised as official court summonses.** The outside of the envelopes read "SUMMONS ENCLOSED—OPEN IMMEDIATELY" and include a return address of "official county summons." The mailers are legal as long as they contain a clear disclaimer indicating who paid for the communication.
