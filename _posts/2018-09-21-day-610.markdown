1/ **Rod Rosenstein raised the idea of wearing a wire last year to secretly record Trump in the White House and expose the chaos in the administration**, according to memos written by Andrew McCabe, then the acting FBI director. Rosenstein also discussed recruiting Jeff Sessions and John Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office. Rosenstein called the report "inaccurate and factually incorrect," adding: "Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment."

2/ **Trump questioned Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's credibility and contended that if the alleged attack "was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed,"** adding: "Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago?" Trump also challenged Dr. Ford to produce law enforcement reports "so that we can learn date, time, and place!" of the attack. Trump added Brett Kavanaugh is "a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians."

* **Susan Collins said she was "appalled" by Trump's tweets criticizing Dr. Ford for not coming forward sooner** with her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. The Maine senator is a key swing vote in the larger Senate vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. ([Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/09/21/collins-appalled-by-trumps-tweet-criticizing-kavanaugh-accuser/))

* **White House officials: "You have no idea" how hard it's been to keep Trump from attacking Dr. Ford**. A few hours before Trump's tweets, a White House official said: "Hopefully he can keep it together until Monday. That's only, like, another 48 hours right?"

3/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to meet some but not all of Dr. Ford's conditions in order for her to testify next week about her allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s by Brett Kavanaugh**. Republicans have not agreed with Ford's lawyers that she should only be questioned by lawmakers – not an outside counsel – at Wednesday's proposed hearing.

* **Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's attorney says her appearance at a hearing on Monday is "not possible" but she could testify later in the week.** Ford's lawyer sent a request to top Senate Judiciary Committee staffers asking to set up a call with them to "discuss the conditions under which \[Ford\] would be prepared to testify next week." Ford has been receiving death threats and has been forced to move out of her home. "She wishes to testify," her attorney wrote to the committee, "provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. A hearing on Monday is not possible and the committee’s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event." Kavanaugh also sent a letter to the committee, saying that he will attend the hearing on Monday "so that I can clear my name."

* **Sen. Diane Feinstein's office has received threats of bodily and sexual harm against her and her staff as a result of her involvement submitting the allegations against Kavanaugh to the FBI.** Some of the threats name specific employees. Feinstein is the second woman senator, after Sen. Susan Collins, whose office has reported receiving such threats. "My office has received some pretty ugly voicemails, threats, terrible things said to my staff," Collins said on Wednesday. ([McClatchy DC](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article218738630.html))

4/ **Mitch McConnell predicts that "in the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the U.S. Supreme Court"** despite Ford not yet testifying. The Senate Majority Leader said "We're going to plow right through it and do our job."

## Notables.

1. **Federal immigration officers from July to September arrested 41 undocumented immigrants who came forward to care for undocumented children held in U.S. custody.** An ICE official confirmed that the move to fully vet those who step up to care for undocumented children has served as another opportunity to track down and arrest more undocumented immigrants. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/politics/ice-arrested-immigrants-sponsor-children/index.html))

2. **The Trump administration imposed sanctions against the Chinese military for purchasing fighter jets and missile systems from Russia.** The purchases breach U.S. sanctions designed to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Chinese government has demanded that the sanctions be withdrawn. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/u-s-sanctions-china-for-buying-russian-fighter-jets-missiles-idUSKCN1M02TP))

3. **Top Democrats promised to investigate Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's business dealings, travels, political activities and industry relations if the party wins back the House in the midterms**. "Zinke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior we've had in living memory," said Rep. Gerry Connolly. Connolly said there is "rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office."
