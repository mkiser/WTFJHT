1/ **Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook page lists him as the treasurer of the "100 Kegs or Bust' club" and a "Renate Alumnius"** – a reference to Renate Schroeder, then a student at a nearby Catholic girls' school. "Renate" appears at least 14 times in Georgetown Preparatory School's 1983 yearbook, including on individuals' pages and in a group photo of nine football players. Two of Kavanaugh's classmates say the Renate mentions were football players' boasting about their supposed sexual conquests with girls.

2/ **Kavanaugh claimed he "never sexually assaulted anyone" in high school because he was a virgin at the time** and "did not have sexual intercourse, or anything close to sexual intercourse, in high school or many years thereafter." Kavanaugh appeared on Fox News with his wife at his side to fight the "smears" against him and declare: "I'm not going anywhere." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/im-kavanaugh-emotional-fox-interview/story?id=58051721) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/24/brett-kavanaugh-tells-fox-he-virgin-catholic-high-school/1415544002/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/kavanaugh-truth-i-ve-never-sexually-assaulted-anyone-n912701) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ive-never-sexually-assaulted-anyone-brett-kavanaugh-offers-deeply-personal-defense-in-fox-news-interview/2018/09/24/57bbc918-c03d-11e8-90c9-23f963eea204_story.html))

3/ **Trump accused Democrats of playing "a con game" and using "false acquisitions" to derail Brett Kavanaugh's nomination**. Trump also dismissed Deborah Ramirez's allegation – the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of wrongdoing – saying "she was totally inebriated" and "all messed up" when Kavanaugh allegedly exposed himself at a dorm party and "thrust his penis in her face and caused her to touch it." Trump later deleted his misspelled tweet and corrected himself to say Democrats are using "an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before." Trump called Kavanaugh "a wonderful man," and urged voters to "REMEMBER THE MIDTERMS!"

4/ **A third woman is expected to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the next 48 hours**, according to Michael Avenatti, her attorney. Avenatti is currently representing multiple clients and "at least one" is prepared to come forward "relating to what she witnessed and experienced concerning Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, and ultimately we're going to let the American public decide who's telling the truth." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/24/brett-kavanaugh-third-woman-expected-to-make-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/politics/michael-avenatti-brett-kavanaugh-cnntv/index.html))

5/ **Trump bragged about that his "administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country" at the United Nations General Assembly**, drawing audible laughter from the world leaders. "I didn't expect that reaction," Trump continued, acknowledging the laughter, "but that's okay."
