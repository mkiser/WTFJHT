1/ **In a sworn declaration, a third accuser said that between 1981 and 1983 she witnessed efforts by Brett Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge to get girls "inebriated and disorientated" so they could be "gang raped" in side rooms** at house parties by a "train" of boys who were lined up and waiting for their "turn" inside the room. Julie Swetnick swore that Kavanaugh and Judge would "'spike' the 'punch' at house parties" with "drugs and/or grain alcohol," and that she witnessed Kavanaugh "being overly aggressive with girls," not taking "No" for an answer, and being "verbally abusive towards girls by making crude sexual comments" intended to demean them. In her declaration, Swetnick describes an incident in 1982 in which she alleges she was the victim of a "gang rape" Kavanaugh was present for. "During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me," Swetnick says. "I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking." Kavanaugh's first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, said Judge was present when Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her 36 years ago. All 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee called for Trump to "immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations."

2/ **Kavanaugh dismissed Swetnick's allegations as "ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone," claiming he is the victim of "grotesque and obvious character assassination."** "I don't know who this is and this never happened," Kavanaugh said. In prepared testimony ahead of Thursday's Senate hearing, Kavanaugh admits that he was "not perfect" in high school and "in retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegation "immediately, unequivocally, and categorically." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kavanaugh-nomination-trump-calls-nominee-an-absolute-gem-as-tensions-swirl-over-planned-hearing/2018/09/26/df224aea-c190-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/kavanaugh-calendar.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/26/jockeying-over-evidence-kavanaugh-hearing-842711))

3/ **Trump attacked Michael Avenatti as a "third rate lawyer" who is "making false accusations" because he's "looking for attention."** Avenatti also represents Stormy Daniels, who was paid by Trump's personal attorney to remain quiet about an affair she allegedly had with Trump a decade ago. Trump capped off the tweet by calling Avenatti "a total low-life!" Avenatti responded by calling Trump a "habitual liar and complete narcissist" and a "disgrace as a president."

4/ **Kavanaugh's second accuser is willing to testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee**, her attorney said. Deborah Ramirez's lawyer expressed concern about her testifying before the FBI is able to conduct an investigation into her claims, saying "we can't even talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee about what that would look like" because "they certainly haven't invited her" to testify. Senate Republicans blew off a scheduled phone call yesterday to discuss Ramirez's claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were in college. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/kavanaugh-second-accuser-testify-before-congress-13090991-a32c-4949-92e3-3613f37edf66.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/408446-second-kavanaugh-accuser-willing-to-testify-lawyer-says) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/25/politics/deborah-ramirez-attorney-kavanaugh-cnntv/index.html) / [Good Morning America](https://www.yahoo.com/gma/2nd-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-certain-alleged-encounter-her-113804221--abc-news-topstories.html))

5/ **Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee selected Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Kavanaugh and Ford.** Mitchell is chief of the special victims division of the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, where she has worked for 26 years. Dr. Ford will testify under oath on Thursday, and Kavanaugh will testify separately later in the day. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/arizona-prosecutor-rachel-mitchell-emerges-as-gop-choice-to-question-kavanaugh-and-accuser-at-hearing/2018/09/25/47964afa-c0ff-11e8-9005-5104e9616c21_story.html?utm_term=.301ddb07c14f) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/rachel-mitchell-bio-facts.html))

* **Senate Democrats have had no contact with Christine Blasey Ford ahead of her Senate Judiciary Committee testimony on Thursday.** Ford's attorneys have been in contact with aides from both parties, but there has been no coordination between Ford's camp and Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/26/kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-hearing-democrats-841955))

* **Ford's attorneys have sworn and signed declarations from four people she told about her claims of sexual assault by Kavanaugh dating back to 2012**. The documents were sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/26/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-told-four-people-sexual-assault-claims/1429270002/))

* **Jeff Flake said he does not believe that Kavanaugh is a "serial sexual predator,"** but called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to have an open mind because both Kavanaugh and Ford are "human beings." ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/26/sen-jeff-flake-asks-senators-have-open-mind-kavanaugh-hearing/1432931002/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/26/flake-committee-kavanaugh-843579))

6/ **A Democratic senator is seeking an injunction to stop a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination, citing "unprecedented obstruction of the Senate's advice and consent obligation" by the White House and Mitch McConnell**. Jeff Merkley argued the handling of Kavanaugh's nomination is "an assault on the separation of powers" and violates the Constitution because the White House has interfered with the Senate's responsibility by blocking access to documents and labeling some "committee confidential." Merkley's filing is unlikely to succeed in stopping the vote. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/26/merkley-injunction-stop-kavanaugh-vote-843080) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/408536-dem-senator-filing-lawsuit-to-block-kavanaugh-vote))

* **Chuck Grassley has scheduled a committee vote on the nomination for Friday** and Mitch McConnell is planning to keep the Senate in session this weekend so he can begin the process of bringing Kavanaugh's nomination up for a final vote early next week. Senate Democrats accused Grassley and McConnell of pre-judging Ford's testimony before they heard it. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/26/jockeying-over-evidence-kavanaugh-hearing-842711))

* **Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused Kavanaugh of misleading the Senate about his handling of grand jury secrets during his time working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the late nineties.** Feinstein charges that by directing officials to speak to reporters during the Bill Clinton investigation, Kavanaugh may have violated grand jury secrecy laws, even though he told Sens. Feinstein and Whitehouse during his testimony earlier this month that he never broke those rules.

2. **Rudy Giuliani posed for pictures with a Canadian white nationalist mayoral candidate.** Faith Goldy is a far-right YouTuber running for mayor in Toronto.

United States* would theoretically allow Trump to pardon people like Manafort for his federal crimes and simultaneously protect him from actions at the state level.
