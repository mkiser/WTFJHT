1/ **Christine Blasey Ford testified that she is "100%" certain that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker**, believing he "was going to rape me" and "was going to accidentally kill me." Ford began her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by telling senators: "I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified." Kavanaugh will testify shortly on sexual assault allegations.

2/ **Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee interviewed two men who claim they were the ones who assaulted Christine Blasey Ford – not Brett Kavanaugh**. The two suggested that Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh may have been a case of mistaken identity – a conspiracy floated last week by conservative legal commentator Ed Whelan, a longtime friend of Kavanaugh's. Neither man intends to come forward publicly.

3/ **Sen. Susan Collins questioned why the Senate Judiciary Committee has not subpoenaed Mark Judge**, a close friend of Kavanaugh's and an alleged witness to the incidents described by Ford and Julia Swetnick. The Republican senator told colleagues in a private meeting that she was troubled by the latest accusations by Swetnick, who said that she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge try to get teenage girls "inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped.'" Collins is a key swing vote and joins GOP Senators Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski, who have expressed reservations about Kavanaugh's nomination. Kavanaugh can't lose more than one GOP senator if all Democrats vote against his nomination.

4/ **An anonymous fourth accuser alleged that Brett Kavanaugh physically assaulted a woman in the D.C. area in 1998 while he was drunk**. The sender of the anonymous letter described an incident between her daughter, Kavanaugh, and several friends in which "they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh, shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually" as they were leaving a bar. The author of the letter said there were "at least four witnesses including my daughter." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/senate-probing-new-allegation-misconduct-against-kavanaugh-n913581))

5/ **Trump called the accusations against Kavanaugh "all false," but that he could "always be convinced" and "could be persuaded" otherwise"** after watching Ford's testimony because "it's possible they will be convincing." Trump also said he would only withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination "if I thought he was guilty of something." Trump said the "false" allegations of sexual misconduct against him "impact my opinion" of Kavanaugh.

6/ **Three Republican governors called for the Senate to delay the Kavanaugh vote** and take its time to examine the sexual assault allegations against him.

## Notables.

1. **The House Intelligence Committee will vote on Friday to release dozens of interview transcripts from its now-defunct Russia investigation.** The transcripts are from interviews that were conducted between June 2017 and March 2018, and will include testimony from Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Roger Stone, and other people who have been close to Trump. The committee is expected to refer the transcripts to the intelligence community for assessment and redaction, which could lead to a rolling release schedule that spans throughout October. Republicans have called for the documents to be released before the November election.
