1/ **Sen. Jeff Flake will vote "yes" on Kavanaugh's committee approval**, ensuring that the Senate Judiciary Committee will advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. Flake said he still has "much doubt" after yesterday's hearings with Kavanaugh and Ford, but he believes "our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence ... absent corroborating evidence."
