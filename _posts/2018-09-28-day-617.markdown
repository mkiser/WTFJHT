1/ **Sen. Jeff Flake voted "yes" on to approve Kavanaugh's nomination in the Judiciary Committee, but asked that the full Senate "delay the floor vote \[...\] in order to let the FBI continue to do an investigation."** The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 to approve the Kavanaugh nomination and send it to the full Senate for consideration. Following the committee vote, Flake added that "I will only be comfortable moving on the floor (vote) until the FBI has done more investigation than they have already," hinting that he may not vote to support Kavanaugh's confirmation without an investigation. Flake also said he was "prepared to \[...\] make a request to the White House to ask the FBI to do that investigation." Chairman Chuck Grassley then immediately adjourned the committee citing the "two-hour rule" despite confusion by senators as Dianne Feinstein asked: "What?"
