1/ **The U.S., Mexico, and Canada reached a deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement**, which will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement. Trump called the agreement "historic news," "an extraordinary agreement," and "a new dawn," claiming that it "solves the many deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA" and that it's "the most important" trade deal ever agreed by the U.S. The new trade deal leaves much of the old NAFTA deal intact. Congressional approval, however, is uncertain if Democrats retake control of the House since Congress won't vote to ratify the agreement until 2019. The deal was reached with Canada shortly before a midnight Sunday deadline imposed by the Trump administration.

2/ **Trump said he supports a "very comprehensive" but "quick" FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh as long as it's "within reason," because "we don't want to go on a witch hunt, do we?"** Trump, the White House and Senate Republicans initially asked the bureau to limit interviews to four people: Mark Judge and P.J. Smyth, high school friends of Kavanaugh's; Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Christine Blasey Ford; and Deborah Ramirez, another of the accusers. The White House, however, has reportedly authorized the FBI to expand its investigation, which Trump wants completed by the end of the week. In a letter to the White House and FBI, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee listed more than two dozen people they wanted interviewed as part of the investigation.

3/ **Sens. Jeff Flake and Chris Coons said that if the FBI investigation finds Kavanaugh lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee then his nomination would likely not move forward.** During an interview, Flake and Coons were asked, "If Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee, nomination's over?" Flake responded, "Oh yes." Coons added: "I would think so."

* **One of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates issued a statement saying the Supreme Court nominee was not truthful about his drinking during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee**. Chad Ludington claimed Kavanaugh made a "blatant mischaracterization" about his drinking while in college.

4/ **Trump called the FBI investigation a "blessing in disguise,"** because "the FBI has a chance reveal a lot of different things," including who leaked the papers. Trump suggested it was Sen. Dianne Feinstein "Because certainly her body language was not exactly very good when they asked her that question." A reporter at The Intercept, who first broke the story about Ford's allegations, tweeted: "Feinstein's staff did not leak the letter to The Intercept."
