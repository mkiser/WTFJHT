1/ **Paul Manafort met with Robert Mueller's office as part of his cooperation agreement**. Following his guilty plea last month to conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiring to obstruct justice, Manafort is required to cooperate "fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly…in any and all matters as to which the government deems the cooperation relevant." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/01/paul-manafort-meets-mueller-prosecutors-855388))

2/ **The intermediary between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told Senate Intelligence Committee that he will plead the Fifth Amendment** in response to its subpoena for testimony and documents. Randy Credico spent more than two hours last month testifying before Robert Mueller's grand jury about stolen Democratic emails. Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, said Credico was his intermediary to Assange and WikiLeaks. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/01/roger-stone-associate-senate-panel-855644))

3/ **Trump directed an effort to prevent Stormy Daniels from publishing a description of her alleged sexual encounter with him.** In February, Trump instructed his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to seek a restraining order against Daniels through a confidential arbitration proceeding and to coordinate the legal response with his son, Eric Trump. Direct involvement by Trump and his son suggest that Trump's ties to his company continued into 2018, contradicting public statements made at the time by the Trump Organization, the White House, and Michael Cohen.

4/ **The Trump administration began denying visas to the unmarried same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and foreign staff working at the United Nations**, making marriage a requirement for foreign couples to remain in the U.S. together. Diplomats with same-sex partners will have until the end of December to get married, or their partners will be sent home in January. Couples could be exposed to prosecution if they return to a country that criminalizes homosexuality or same-sex marriages. 12% of U.N. members states allow same-sex marriage.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/02/white-house-trump-transcript-reporter-860406) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/white-house-transcript-thinking-thanking-trump/index.html))

## 👨‍⚖️ Dept. of Kavanaugh.

1. **Text messages between Brett Kavanaugh and a former classmate at Yale shows Kavanaugh and his team were working behind the scenes to refute Deborah Ramirez's allegations against him before they were made public.** Kerry Berchem tried to get the text messages to the FBI so they can be reviewed as part of the new investigation, but has yet to be contacted by the FBI. The texts suggest that Kavanaugh was personally communicating with former classmates about the allegations before they were made public in a New Yorker article. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/mutual-friend-ramirez-kavanaugh-anxious-come-forward-evidence-n915566))

2. **As an undergraduate at Yale in 1985, Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar and was accused of throwing ice at another patron.** The incident led the New Haven Police Department to question Kavanaugh and four other men. Kavanaugh was not arrested in connection with the incident. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/politics/kavanaugh-bar-fight.html))

3. **Julie Swetnick, speaking publicly for the first time, said she was raped at a party that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge attended, but "cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me."** Swetnick said Kavanaugh "was very aggressive — very sloppy drunk, very mean drunk. I saw him — go up to girls and paw on them, try to, you know, get a little too handsy, touching them in private parts. I saw him try to shift clothing." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/kavanaugh-accuser-julie-swetnick-speaks-out-sexual-abuse-allegations-n915641))

4. **Republican Sen. Susan Collins called on the FBI to investigate Julie Swetnick's allegations against Kavanaugh as part of its probe.** "Senator Collins was encouraged by the President’s statements that he would give the FBI agents the latitude they need to do their work," said a spokesperson for Sen. Collins. "It makes sense to start with the four named witnesses from the hearing and then the FBI can follow any leads that it believes need to be pursued, as Senators Flake, Murkowski, and Collins indicated at the time this agreement was made." ([Portland Press Herald](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/10/01/sen-collins-wants-swetnick-interviewed-as-part-of-broader-investigation-into-kavanaugh/))

The complaints are being administered by Merrick Garland. ([Law and Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/brett-kavanaugh-slapped-with-two-official-ethics-complaints-in-d-c-circuit-court/))

6. **Mitch McConnell: "We'll be voting this week."** The Senate Majority Leader said "the time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close." ([The Hill)](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/409340-mcconnell-senate-will-hold-kavanaugh-vote-this-week))
