1/ **The Senate voted 51-49 to advance Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination**. Republican Lisa Murkowski voted not to advance the nomination. She called the cloture vote "a mistake," saying Kavanaugh is "not the best man for the court at this time." Flake told reporters he would support Kavanaugh on the final vote, "unless something big changes." A final floor vote is expected to take place on Saturday.

2/ **Susan Collins will support Kavanaugh's nomination, effectively ensuring enough votes for his confirmation**. During a lengthy speech, Collins said the confirmation process has "been in steady decline for more than 30 years," with Kavanaugh's nomination hitting "rock bottom." She said it's her "fervent hope" that Kavanaugh will "work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court." Collins added that "the MeToo movement is real," that "it matters," is "needed and it is long overdue," but that Christine Blasey Ford's "allegations fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard" and "I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court."
