1/ **The Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 50-48 vote**. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted "present," although she said she opposed the nomination. Joe Manchin was the lone "yes" vote from the Democrats. Kavanaugh is the first justice nominated by a president who lost the popular vote, confirmed by senators representing less than half of the country, while also having his nomination opposed by a majority of the country. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/06/senators-representing-less-than-half-us-are-about-confirm-nominee-opposed-by-most-americans/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/06/politics/kavanaugh-final-confirmation-vote/index.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/06/brett-kavanaugh-confirmed-us-supreme-court) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654409999/final-senate-vote-on-kavanaugh-nomination-expected-saturday))

* **Chief Justice John Roberts has already received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints against Kavanaugh.** Roberts has chosen not to refer the complaints to a judicial panel for investigation. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dc-circuit-sent-complaints-about-kavanaughs-testimony-to-chief-justice-roberts/2018/10/06/c7e7b526-c8d0-11e8-b1ed-1d2d65b86d0c_story.html?utm_term=.9ac2a29fbed3))

* **The campaign to impeach Justice Kavanaugh has begun**. A petition to impeach Kavanaugh gathered more than 125,000 signatures, but while it takes majority of the House to impeach a federal official, removing them requires a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate – or 67 votes. ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/impeach-kavanaugh-after-official-supreme-court-1156784) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/impeaching-kavanaugh-rouses-progressive-democrats-after-confirmation-n917376))

2/ **Trump called the allegations against Kavanaugh "a hoax that was set up by the Democrats."** He said talk of impeaching Kavanaugh was "an insult to the American public." ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/410408-trump-calls-kavanaugh-allegations-a-hoax-set-up-by-the-democrats) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-calls-to-impeach-kavanaugh-are-an-insult-to-the-american-public/2018/10/08/f3cb244c-cae3-11e8-a3e6-44daa3d35ede_story.html))

* **Mitch McConnell called for an investigation into the leak of Christine Blasey Ford's letter to Diane Feinstein**, which alleges that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/07/christine-blasey-ford-leak-investigation-880177))

* **John Kelly formed a working group to prepare for the possibility of investigations if Democrats win the House**. "Subpoenas flowing into a White House create paralysis," said Neil Eggleston, Obama's White House counsel. "The whole system stops while everyone tries to comply with subpoenas and prepare to testify." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/white-house-prepping-trump-democratic-legal-storm-6802dc91-bb27-4e14-86ba-028aab3bd793.html))

* **Susan Rice said she'll decide after the midterm elections on whether to run and try to unseat Susan Collins in 2020**, who was the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Rice was Obama's national security adviser. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/susan-rice-2020-challenge-collins-maine-58348163) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/susan-rice-says-shell-decide-after-midterm-elections-whether-to-challenge-susan-collins-in-2020/2018/10/08/40c17e0c-cae6-11e8-a3e6-44daa3d35ede_story.html))

* **Ford has not been able to return to her home due to constant threats**, according to her attorneys. "They are not living at home \[...\] The threats have been unending, it's deplorable." Ford "still believes \[coming forward\] was the right thing to do." ([HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christine-blasey-ford-home-unending-threats_us_5bbaa112e4b0876eda9f3317))

3/ **Trump won't fire Rod Rosenstein after all**, saying they have a "very good relationship." Trump and Rosenstein met following reports that Rosenstein wanted to wiretap the president and using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Rosenstein oversees the Russia probe led by Robert Mueller, whose work Trump has labeled a "witch hunt." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/politics/rosenstein-trump-travel-florida.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/trump-no-plans-to-fire-rosenstein/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rosenstein-to-fly-with-trump-to-florida-on-monday-official-says/2018/10/08/42e105f2-caed-11e8-a3e6-44daa3d35ede_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/08/rosenstein-trump-travel-880973))

4/ **A U.N. report on the effects of climate change predicts a strong risk of an environmental crises much sooner than expected**. The report finds that the atmosphere could warm by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, which would cause sea-levels to rise, intensify droughts, wildfires, and poverty, and cause a mass die-off of coral reefs. To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and fully eliminated by 2050. The use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40% today to between 1 and 7% by 2050. Renewable energy would have to increase to about 67%. Trump has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, vowing to increase the burning of coal and intends to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement. The world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark and "there is no documented historic precedent" for the scale of changes required, the report said. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/))

poll/ **51% of Americans oppose Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court with 41% supporting it**. Among Democrats, 91% opposed his nomination, while 89% of Republicans support it. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/cnn-poll-kavanaugh-confirmation/index.html))
