1/ **Rick Gates requested proposals in 2016 from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to gather intelligence in order to defeat Republican primary race opponents, as well as Hillary Clinton.** Gates joined the Trump campaign along with Paul Manafort. Both have been indicted on multiple charges of financial fraud and tax evasion. One proposal from the company, known as Psy-Group, called for the creation of fake online personas to target and persuade 5,000 delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention by attacking Ted Cruz. Another called for opposition research and "complementary intelligence activities" aimed at Clinton and her close allies. There is no evidence that the Trump campaign acted on the proposals, but Psy-Group's owner Joel Zamel did meet with Trump Jr. in August 2016.

2/ **Nikki Haley resigned as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations** and will leave at the end of the year. Trump said that Haley informed him about six months ago that she would "take a break" at the end of her first two years. Haley said she doesn't plan to run for president against Trump in 2020 and will support Trump's re-election. Trump plans to name a successor in two to three weeks ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/politics/nikki-haley-united-nations.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hell-make-an-announcement-about-nikki-haley-amid-reports-she-is-resigning-as-un-ambassador/2018/10/09/bfd62eee-cbcd-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/09/nikki-haley-resigns-884156) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-nikki-haley-resignation-d25b64a9-264e-483a-a79b-ae8a48e367db.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/nikki-haley-resign-trump-s-ambassador-united-nations-n918076) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/09/politics/nikki-haley-resignation/index.html))

* After announcing her resignation, Haley called Jared Kushner a "hidden genius that no one understands." She added: "We're a better country because \[Jared and Ivanka Trump are\] in this administration."

## 📌 Don't forget... 

* **[Day 621](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/10/02/day-621/): Trump inherited his family's wealth through fraud and questionable tax schemes**, receiving the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father's real estate empire. Trump has repeatedly claimed that "I built what I build myself." Trump and his siblings used fake corporations to hide financial gifts from his parents, which helped his father claim millions in tax deductions. Trump also helped his parents undervalue their real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars when filing their tax returns. In total, Fred and Mary Trump transferred more than a $1 billion in wealth to their children and paid a total of $52.2 million in taxes (about 5%) instead of the $550\+ million they should have owed under the 55% tax rate imposed on gifts and inheritances. Trump also "earned" $200,000 a year in today's dollars starting at age 3 from his father's companies. After college, Trump started receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year, which increased to $5 million a year when he was in his 40s and 50s. Trump has refused to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. There is no time limit on civil fines for tax fraud. \[*Editor's note: This is a must read. An abstract summary does not suffice.\]* ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html))

* **[Day 627](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/10/08/day-627/): A U.N. report on the effects of climate change predicts a strong risk of an environmental crises much sooner than expected**. The report finds that the atmosphere could warm by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, which would cause sea-levels to rise, intensify droughts, wildfires, and poverty, and cause a mass die-off of coral reefs. To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and fully eliminated by 2050. The use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40% today to between 1 and 7% by 2050. Renewable energy would have to increase to about 67%. Trump has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, vowing to increase the burning of coal and intends to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement. The world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark and "there is no documented historic precedent" for the scale of changes required, the report said.

## Notables.

1. **The Trump administration will remove a federal ban on the summer sales of high-ethanol gasoline blends.** The policy change would allow year-round sales of gasoline blends with up to 15% ethanol – 5% higher than typical blends. The EPA currently bans high-ethanol blends during the summer because they contribute to smog on hot days. The move is seen as a reward to Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and presided over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-plans-to-allow-sales-of-gas-with-higher-ethanol-blend/))

3. **More than a thousand noncitizens may have been registered to vote in California due to a processing error.** The California Department of Motor Vehicles admitted that a mistake had caused as many as 1,500 noncitizens to be registered to vote in the state. A Canadian citizen and legal permanent resident of the U.S. first brought attention to the mistake after he received a letter in the mail telling him he was registered to vote.
