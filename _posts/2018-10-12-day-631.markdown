1/ **The Trump administration is considering new rules to separate parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border**. One option is for the government to detain asylum-seeking families together for up to 20 days, then give parents a choice to stay in family detention together or allow children to be taken to a government shelter so relatives or guardians can seek custody. Some inside the White House and Department of Homeland Security are concerned about the "optics" of the so-called "binary choice" option. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/trump-administration-weighs-new-family-separation-effort-at-border/2018/10/12/45895cce-cd7b-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html))

2/ **Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross discussed adding a citizenship question to the U.S. census with Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach** despite previously saying he hadn't spoken with anyone at the White House about the addition. Ross original claimed that a citizenship question would allow the government to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, which is meant to protect voters from discriminatory policies. However, emails reveal that Ross was instead concerned that not adding a citizenship question "leads to the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional apportionment purposes." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/12/new-emails-reveal-central-political-motivation-changing-census/?utm_term=.5a99b6f998ac))

3/ **Wilbur Ross shifted his explanation for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census**, saying he now recalls discussing it with Steve Bannon. Ross faces a court order to provide a deposition to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking to remove the question from the census.

4/ **Trump could fire Jeff Sessions and then replace him with a temporary attorney general who would then reduce Robert Mueller's budget "so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt."** Matthew Whitaker made the comments in July 2017. Trump is considering as many as five candidates to replace Sessions if he leaves as attorney general, including Whitaker. Trump declined to deny that he is considering replacing Sessions with Whitaker, but he has [talked](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/10/11/day-630/#3-trump-spoke-with-jeff-sessions-own) with Whitaker about replacing Sessions in the past.

5/ **Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a Hatch Act complaint against Sarah Huckabee Sanders** for using her official government Twitter account to [tweet](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1050536511173742592) a photo of herself with Kanye West, who was wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat in the Oval Office. The Hatch Act prohibits any executive branch employee from "us\[ing\] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election."

2. **Trump on Khashoggi: "It's in Turkey, and it's not a citizen, as I understand it."** Trump later added: "Again, this took place in Turkey, and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen. Is that right?"
