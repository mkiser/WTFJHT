1/ **Trump suggested that "rogue killers" may be responsible for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi** because King Salman "firmly denied any knowledge" of what happened. "It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers," Trump said. "Who knows?" During an interview with "60 Minutes," Trump said that even though the Saudis denied involvement in Khashoggi's disappearance, it was still possible that they were responsible. "We're going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/politics/trump-saudi-king-journalist-khashoggi.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/pompeo-meets-saudi-king-900193) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-donald-trump-vows-severe-punishment-if-saudi-arabia-is-behind-saudi-missing-journalist/))

2/ **The Saudis are preparing to admit that Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong**. Previously, Saudi authorities had maintained Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but provided no evidence to support the claim. two sources said the Saudis are preparing report that will conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and that those involved will be held responsible.

3/ **Jared Kushner appears to have paid almost no federal income taxes from 2009 to 2016**. Kushner used a tax-minimizing loophole that kept his tax bill low by reporting real estate losses based on "significant depreciation," according confidential financial documents. Nothing in the documents indicate that Kushner broke the law. Despite Kushner Companies being profitable, Kushner has been losing money for years as far as the IRS is concerned, because the losses were driven by depreciation. Real estate investors deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income every year. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/business/jared-kushner-taxes.html))

* 📌 **The Re-up:** **Trump inherited his family's wealth through fraud and questionable tax schemes**, receiving the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father's real estate empire. Trump has repeatedly claimed that "I built what I built myself." Trump and his siblings used fake corporations to hide financial gifts from their parents, which helped Fred Trump claim millions in tax deductions. Trump also helped his parents undervalue their real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars when filing their tax returns. In total, Fred and Mary Trump transferred more than $1 billion in wealth to their children and paid a total of $52.2 million in taxes (about 5%) instead of the $550\+ million they should have owed under the 55% tax rate imposed on gifts and inheritances. Trump also "earned" $200,000 a year in today's dollars from his father's companies starting at age 3. After college, Trump started receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year, which increased to $5 million a year when he was in his 40s and 50s. Trump has refused to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. There is no time limit on civil fines for tax fraud. \[*Editor's note: This is a must read.

5/ **Trump denied offering Warren $1 million to take a test proving her Native American heritage**. "Who cares?" Trump said when asked about Warren's DNA test. "I didn't say that. You better read it again." At a rally in July, Trump said: "And we will say, 'I will give you a million dollars, paid for by Trump, to your favorite charity if you take the test and it shows you're an Indian ... we'll see what she does. I have a feeling she will say no but we will hold it for the debates."
