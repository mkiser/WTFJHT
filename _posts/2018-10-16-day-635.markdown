1/ **A federal judge dismissed Stormy Daniels' libel lawsuit against Trump**, saying Trump's tweet that she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged relationship was "rhetorical hyperbole" and is protected by the First Amendment. Daniels was ordered to pay Trump's legal fees for the case. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-throws-out-stormy-danielss-lawsuit-against-trump/2018/10/15/402935e8-d0cc-11e8-b2d2-f397227b43f0_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/stormy-daniels-trump-libel-suit-903152))

3/ **Trump called Elizabeth Warren a "phony" and a "fraud"** while referring to her as "Pocahontas (the bad version)" a day after she publicly released the results of a DNA test intended to prove her Native American ancestry. The DNA test concluded that there was "strong evidence" that Warren had a Native American in her family tree dating back six to 10 generations, making her between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American. The Cherokee Nation, meanwhile, criticized Warren's use of a DNA test as "inappropriate."

4/ **Mike Pompeo: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman will support a "thorough, transparent, and timely investigation" into the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi**. Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that Bin Salman "totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate." Trump has vowed "severe punishment" if the Saudis killed Khashoggi. He's also speculated that "rogue killers" may be responsible. Trump sent Pompeo to Saudi Arabia as the Kingdom was preparing to acknowledge that Khashoggi died at the consulate as a result of an interrogation that went wrong.
