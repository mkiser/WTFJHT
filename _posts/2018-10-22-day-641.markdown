1/ **Saudi Arabia's foreign minister denied that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Jamal Khashoggi's killing**, calling it a "rogue operation" by individuals who "made a mistake." Adel al-Jubeir denied that the crown prince had any prior knowledge of the operation and said that the agents involved "weren't people closely tied" to him. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/khashoggis-death-was-a-rogue-operation-that-the-crown-prince-was-not-aware-of-saudi-foreign-minister-says/2018/10/21/97ee4c06-d3d2-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html))

2/ **Surveillance video: A Saudi agent walked out of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul wearing Khashoggi's clothes, a fake beard, and glasses in order to create a misleading trail of evidence**. The man in the video, identified as Mustafa al-Madani, was part of the 15-man team that flew to Istanbul to confront Khashoggi. He was seen leaving the consulate through the back door and later at the Blue Mosque. Several members of the team have ties to the crown prince.

3/ **Jared Kushner said the White House is still "fact-finding" about the circumstances of Khashoggi's death**, declining to say whether he believes Saudi Arabia's explanation that Khashoggi accidentally died during a fistfight inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. "Once we have all the facts, we'll make an assessment." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/world/middleeast/kushner-khashoggi-prince-mbs.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-declines-to-say-whether-he-believes-saudi-account-of-khashoggis-death/2018/10/22/9e65a9e4-d607-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html))

4/ **The Trump administration plans to redefine the legal definition of gender as strictly biological, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with**. The effort by the Department of Health and Human Services would establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, effectively narrowing the definition of gender and deny federal recognition and civil rights protections to transgender Americans. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html))

* **The Education Department is expected to narrow the definition of sexual assault that schools are required to consider**, providing more rights to those accused of assault.

5/ **Robert Mueller's team continues to pursue conflicting accounts about Roger Stone's communication with WikiLeaks**. During the presidential campaign, Stone claimed he was in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, predicting that WikiLeaks would release information related to Hillary Clinton. Stone suggested that his friend Randy Credico "was my principal source regarding the allegedly hacked emails published by WikiLeaks." Credico has denied the claim, telling Mueller's grand jury that Stone told him during the 2016 campaign that he had a secret back channel to WikiLeaks. Investigators are also looking into whether Stone shared information that he believed was from WikiLeaks with members of Trump's presidential campaign.
