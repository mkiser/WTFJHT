1/ **Trump called the Saudi operation to kill Jamal Khashoggi one of "worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups,"** saying "they had a very bad original concept." He added that "somebody really messed up," and that he would "leave it up to Congress" to punish Saudi Arabia.

2/ **The Saudi cover story fell apart because the Khashoggi "body double" wore the wrong shoes**. Video footage shows a man exiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Oct. 2 wearing a fake beard and glasses, as well as the pants, shirt and jacket that Khashoggi was seen wearing when he entered the building earlier in the day. "It was a flawed body double, so it never became an official part of the Saudi government's narrative," a diplomat said.
