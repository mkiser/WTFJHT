1/ **The Secret Service intercepted packages containing "potential explosive devices" addressed to Obama and Hillary Clinton**, similar to the one found at the home of George Soros on Monday. All three devices are of similar pipe-bomb-style construction. The Secret Service said "the packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such." Contrary to reports, a suspicious package was not sent to the White House.

2/ **A similar device was sent to CNN's headquarter in New York**, addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan. The package contained a white powder. Brennan doesn't work for CNN, but is a national security and intelligence analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. CNN's New York bureau in the Time Warner Center was evacuated.

3/ **The return address on the packages addressed to Soros, CNN, Obama, and the Clintons listed Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz**, who currently serves as a representative for Florida's 23rd congressional district and is the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Wasserman Schultz's office was also evacuated after a suspicious package was discovered. It was misaddressed to Eric Holder and returned to Wasserman Schultz's office, because that was the return address on the package.

4/ **Trump and the White House condemned the "attempted violent attacks," calling them "despicable acts."** He added that "threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America."

Pence tweeted that the "attempted attacks" are "cowardly" and "despicable." Trump retweeted Pence's statement, adding: "I agree wholeheartedly!"

* **Pro-Trump groups called the bomb threats merely a "false flag" operation** and a convenient political stunt set up by Democrats two weeks before Election Day. ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-trump-media-insists-bomb-threats-against-clinton-obama-cnn-are-pure-bs-a-false-flag))

5/ **Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called the killing of Jamal Khashoggi a "heinous crime that cannot be justified."** He maintained his innocence, however, calling Khashoggi's murder "really painful to all Saudis" and to "every human being in the world." He accused unidentified critics of trying to use the case to "drive a wedge" between Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

6/ **Trump called the murder of Jamal Khashoggi "a total fiasco,"** saying Saudi Arabia should never have thought about killing Khashoggi in the first place because "everything else they did was bad too." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/9c79116125c740d084eaf3576d8958a8))

7/ **Chinese and Russian spies are routinely eavesdropping on Trump's cellphone calls**, despite aides repeatedly warning him that his personal iPhone is not secure. Trump has two official iPhones that have been secured by the National Security Agency, but he uses a personal iPhone because it can store contacts on it. As a presidential candidate, Trump regularly attacked Hillary Clinton for her use of an unsecured email server while she was secretary state. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-phone-security.html))
