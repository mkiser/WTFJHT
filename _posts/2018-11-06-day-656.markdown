## Notables.

1. **U.S. military personnel will not be "involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States" at the southern border**, according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "There is no plan for US military forces to be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States," Gen. Joseph Dunford said. "There is no plan for soldiers to come in contact with immigrants or to reinforce Department of Homeland Security as they're conducting their mission." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/05/politics/chairman-joint-chiefs-soldiers-border-migrants/index.html))

2. **The White House asked the Supreme Court to rule on the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program** before three pending cases at the federal appellate level complete the normal appeals process. DACA is currently accepting renewals but not new applicants. If the program ends, about 700,000 protected individuals could be deported.

4. **Cesar Sayoc is scheduled to appear in court in New York today to face charges that he mailed pipe bombs.** Prosecutors will ask the judge to hold Sayoc without bail because he is considered dangerous to the public.

5. **Trump: "I would like to have a much softer tone," but "I have no choice."** Trump blamed the current vitriol in political discourse on the election season, then at a rally later Monday called the Democratic candidate for Ohio governor, a "bad person," revived his "Pocahontas" insult for Elizabeth Warren, attacked the news media, demanded that security remove protesters, and criticized Dianne Feinstein's role in Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing.
