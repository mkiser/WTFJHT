"Tomorrow will be a new day in America," Nancy Pelosi said in a victory speech. "Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration." Some key races are still too close to call as of Wednesday morning.

Democrats flipped the governorships in Wisconsin, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada and New Mexico. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-expected-to-pick-up-governorships-but-many-races-are-too-close-to-call/2018/11/06/ed07bf48-dfa7-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html))

6/ **Jeff Sessions resigned at Trump's request**. Matthew Whitaker – Sessions's chief of staff – will take over as acting attorney general and assume oversight of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and possible collusion by Trump's campaign. Rod Rosenstein was overseeing the probe because Sessions had recused himself from any involvement with the special counsel. A DOJ spokesperson indicated that Whitaker would take over "all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice" – including the Mueller probe. Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions for recusing himself from oversight of the probe in 2017 after it was revealed that he had met more than once with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign despite saying he had not met with any Russians during his confirmation hearing. Mueller, meanwhile, has been looking into Trump's previous statements about wanting to fire Sessions or force his resignation to determine whether those acts are part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice. Whitaker by law can serve as acting attorney general for a maximum of 210 days.

* **In a 2017 [opinion piece](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/opinions/rosenstein-should-curb-mueller-whittaker-opinion/index.html), Whitaker called for Mueller to "limit the scope of his investigation."** Whitaker also previously discussed how a Sessions replacement could reduce Mueller's budget "so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt."

The House Judiciary Committee is expected to focus on health care, beginning with an investigation of Sessions's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit from Republican-led states. The House Intelligence Committee is expected to revisit Russian election meddling. The Education and Workforce Committee will likely examine Betsy DeVos's efforts to relax regulations for for-profit colleges and limit student loan forgiveness, and the Ways and Means Committee could use a 1924 law to request Trump's tax returns and then make them public with a simple majority vote.

Trump promised to make "beautiful" deals with Democrats.

8/ **Trump Jr. told friends he expects to be indicted by Mueller soon**. One former West Wing official who testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, said "I'm very worried about Don Jr.," fearing that Mueller could demonstrate that Trump Jr. perjured himself after he testified that he never told his father beforehand about the June 2016 Trump Tower with Russian officials promising "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. Mueller is expected to submit his final report to the Justice Department in the coming months. John Kelly and former White House counsel McGahn urged Trump to wait until Mueller issues his report to fire Sessions.
