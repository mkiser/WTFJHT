1/ **Trump called for Florida to suspend its legally required recount and declare the Republican candidates for Senate and governor the winners** of their respective races. Without evidence, Trump claimed that "many ballots are missing or forged," and that "an honest vote count is no longer possible – ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!" In the governor's race, unofficial results showed Ron DeSantis leading Democratic mayor, Andrew Gillum, by 0.41%, and in the Senate race, Republican governor Rick Scott leads incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson by 0.14%. Florida's 67 counties are required to complete their recounts by Thursday.

* **Without evidence, Rick Scott accused Bill Nelson of trying to "commit fraud to try to win this election."** State elections and law enforcement officials say there is no evidence suggesting Scott's allegations are true. Florida's Senate race is one of three statewide contests headed to an automatic recount, after the unofficial deadline for counties to report results passed at noon Saturday. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/11/florida-recount-rick-scott-accuses-bill-nelson-voter-fraud) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/12/politics/florida-recount-republicans-claim-fraud-democrats-call-scott-dictator/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/11/florida-senate-scott-nelson-fraud-982952))

* **Nelson called on Scott to recuse himself from "any role" in the recount that will determine the winner of their race**. The recount is overseen by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican who was appointed to his position in 2012 by Scott. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/nelson-charges-scott-undermining-florida-election-demands-he-recuse-himself-n935291))

* **An ethics complaint asserts that Scott broke state law when he held a press conference in front of the governor's mansion** on Nov. 8 to claim that he would not "sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal" his Senate race.

* **The election overseer for Palm Beach County in Florida says there is no way the machine recount will be finished by Thursday's deadline.** "It's impossible," said the supervisor of elections.

Palm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett said the inability to meet the deadline was "good news for Republicans because our candidates are ahead." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/11/politics/florida-recount-palm-beach-county/index.html))

2/ **A year before Jamal Khashoggi was killed, Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed using private companies to assassinate enemies of the kingdom**. Saudi officials have claimed that Khashoggi's death was a rogue killing ordered by an official who has since been fired. Turkish officials say Mohammad al-Otaibi, Saudi Arabia's consul general in Istanbul at the time, as an accessory to the killing of Khashoggi has been established through his early denials and refusal to give investigators access to the consulate after Khashoggi's disappearance. Otaibi was not among the Saudis arrested or fired.

3/ **North Korea has continued its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases identified in new satellite images**. The existence of the ballistic missile bases contradicts Trump's assertion that North Korea was "no longer a nuclear threat" following his June summit with dictator Kim Jong Un. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-keeping-up-work-on-missile-sites-report-says-1542039838) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/12/politics/north-korea-hidden-missile-bases/index.html) / [Washignton Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/12/newly-revealed-north-korean-missile-bases-cast-doubt-value-trumps-summit-with-kim-jong-un/))

4/ **Michael Cohen and his criminal defense lawyer, Guy Petrillo, met Robert Mueller's investigators**.

Jerry Nadler added that if Trump is found to have violated campaign finance laws with hush payments, it "might very well be an impeachable offense."
