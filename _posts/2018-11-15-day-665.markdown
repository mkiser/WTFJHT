1/ **A federal judge ruled that Florida voters have until Saturday to correct their rejected mail-in and provisional ballots**, saying the state's law requiring signatures on ballots to match those on file is being applied unconstitutionally. More than 4,000 ballots across 45 counties in Florida were not counted because of inconsistent signatures. In 22 other counties, the number is unknown. In the Senate race, Gov. Rick Scott (R) leads Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by fewer than 13,000 votes. In the gubernatorial race, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) leads Andrew Gillum (D) by nearly 34,000 votes.

2/ **The same judge denied a request to extend the deadline for elections officials to complete a machine recount** despite Palm Beach County's election supervisor saying they would not meet the deadline. Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee called Florida "the laughingstock of the world election after election and we chose not to fix this." Counties that do not complete the machine recount in time will revert to the unofficial results tabulated on Saturday. Races that remain within one quarter of one percentage point after the deadline will proceed to a manual recount, and will have until Sunday at noon to review ballots.

3/ **Trump made up an accusation that Robert Mueller was "horribly threatening" witnesses to force them to cooperate in the Russia probe**. The renewed attack on the special counsel comes one day after Mitch McConnell blocked an effort to protect Mueller's work. Trump called Mueller's investigation "A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!" and "a total mess" that has "gone absolutely nuts." Trump also defended his administration, saying it "is running very smoothly" and not "in chaos" or having a "meltdown," but rather the U.S. under his presidency has become "the envy of the world." He provided no evidence to support his claim.

* **Mueller's team is investigating witness tampering by Roger Stone.** Mueller is exploring whether Stone tried to intimidate and discredit a witness who contradicted his story about his contacts with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 presidential campaign. ([Wall Street Journal](https://outline.com/7W7nAr))

* **In a two-paragraph legal filing, Mueller said former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates is cooperating with prosecutors on "several ongoing investigations,"** and it's not appropriate to start his sentencing process. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/mueller-says-gates-still-cooperating-in-several-investigations))

* **Text messages show Stone discussed WikiLeaks with a friend six days before it began releasing the Clinton campaign's hacked emails.** The text messages appear to show Randy Credico providing regular updates to Stone on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's plans to release the hacked emails. In the exchange, Credico tells Stone on Oct. 1, 2016, that "Hillary's campaign will die this week" because of "big news Wednesday." Nothing about Clinton was released that Wednesday, but two days later, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks dropped its first dump of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/exclusive-text-messages-show-stone-friend-discussing-wikileaks-plans-n936371))
