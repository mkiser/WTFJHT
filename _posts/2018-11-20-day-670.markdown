1/ **Trump won't take action against Saudi Arabia or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the death of Jamal Khashoggi**, issuing an exclamation-point laden statement that defended the Kingdom and effectively closed the door on the issue. Trump questioned the CIA's assessment that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's assassination, saying: "It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn't!" Regardless, Trump said, the U.S. "intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia" despite calling the "crime" against Khashoggi "terrible" and "one that our country does not condone." The statement was subtitled "America First!"

2/ **Ivanka Trump repeatedly used a private email account to conduct government business in 2017.** A White House review found her personal email use included exchanges with cabinet secretaries and forwards of her schedule to her assistant, with hundreds of messages being in violation of federal records rules. Ivanka claimed she didn't know the rules about using a personal email account for government business.

3/ **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants crossing the U.S. border illegally.** U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar rejected Trump's Nov. 9 proclamation that said anyone who failed to cross into the U.S. at a designated port of entry would not be granted asylum. "Whatever the scope of the President’s authority," Judge Tigar wrote, "he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden." The ruling will remain in effect for one month barring any further appeals.
