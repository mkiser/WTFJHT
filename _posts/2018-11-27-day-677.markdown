1/ **Paul Manafort violated his cooperation agreement with Robert Mueller by repeatedly lying to federal investigators**, according to a court filing by the special counsel's office. Prosecutors claim Manafort's "crimes and lies" about "a variety of subject matters" relieve them of any promises made to Manafort as part of the plea agreement. Manafort cannot withdraw his guilty plea and without a deal, he now faces at least a decade in prison after pleading guilty in September to conspiring to defraud the U.S. and conspiring to obstruct justice. In August, a federal court jury in Alexandria, Va., convicted the former Trump campaign chairman on eight felony counts and deadlocked on 10 others.

2/ **Manafort allegedly held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadoran embassy in London**. Manafort met with the WikiLeaks founder around March 2016 – about the same time he joined Trump's presidential campaign. Several months later, WikiLeaks published the Democratic emails stolen by Russia. Manafort also met with Assange in 2013 and 2015. It's unclear why Manafort met with Assange or what they discussed. Manafort and WikiLeak both denied that Manafort had met with Assange. *\[Editor's Note: Something about this story doesn't smell right.\]* ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/manafort-held-secret-talks-with-assange-in-ecuadorian-embassy?CMP=share_btn_tw) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/27/mueller-eyeing-meeting-between-manafort-and-ecuadors-president.html))

* **Jerome Corsi emailed Roger Stone two months before WikiLeaks released emails stolen from the Clinton campaign**, saying "Word is (Julian Assange) plans 2 more dumps...Impact planned to be very damaging." On July 25, 2016, Stone emailed Corsi, directing him to "Get to (Assange) \[a\]t Ecuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending (WikiLeaks) emails." Corsi passed the directive along to conservative author Ted Malloch. Eight days later, Corsi emailed Stone saying that WikiLeaks had information that would be damaging to Clinton's campaign and planned to release it in October.

* **Corsi claimed he received "limited immunity" from Mueller in order to talk about a "cover story" he crafted for Stone to help explain Stone's Aug. 21, 2016, tweet saying it would "soon be \[the\] Podesta's time in the barrel."** Corsi also claimed he has a joint defense agreement with Trump.

* **Corsi rejected a deal offered by Mueller to plead guilty to one count of perjury**, saying: "They want me to say I willfully lied. I'm not going to agree that I lied. I did not. I will not lie to save my life. I'd rather sit in prison and rot for as long as these thugs want me to." Corsi, who is associated with Roger Stone, said he was offered a deal on one count of perjury.

* **Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017**. They're specifically asking if WikiLeaks or Julian Assange were discussed in the meeting. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/politics/paul-manafort-julian-assange-meetings/index.html))

* **A federal judge appeared reluctant to unseal a criminal complaint against Assange due to the government's "compelling interest"** in keeping the records under wraps until he is arrested. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/politics/brinkema-defers-assange-ruling/index.html))

3/ **Trump attacked Mueller after Manafort was accused of lying**. Trump called the special counsel a "conflicted prosecutor gone rogue" and claimed Mueller is doing "TREMENDOUS damage" to the criminal justice system. Trump also accused the special counsel team of forcing witnesses to lie. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, said she was not aware of any discussions about a potential presidential pardon for Manafort.

4/ **The Senate could vote on a bill to protect Mueller**. Jeff Flake has said he will oppose all of Trump's judicial nominees until there is a vote on a bill to codify some protections for special counsel investigations. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said Republicans are willing to hold a vote "if that's what it's going to take" to get more of Trump's nominations through the Judiciary Committee.
