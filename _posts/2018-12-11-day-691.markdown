1/ **Trump claimed he'd be "proud to shut down the government" if his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding isn't met**. In an extended, heated, and televised exchange with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Trump declared that "I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. I am proud to shut down the government for border security. \[...\] I will take the mantle \[...\] for shutting down the government." Schumer and Pelosi said they made two offers to Trump at the current level of $1.375 billion. Prior to the meeting, Trump falsely tweeted that that substantial part of his "Great Wall" had already been built and then threatened that "if the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall." Schumer accused Trump of throwing a "temper tantrum" with the meeting ending with no resolution, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown at the end of next week.

* **After the meeting, Pelosi questioned Trump's manhood and called the border wall a matter of masculine pride**. Trump "must have said the word 'wall' 30 times," the House minority leader said. "It's like a manhood thing with him — as if manhood can be associated with him," she added. "This wall thing."

2/ **The Trump administration plans to unveil sweeping changes to federal clean water rules that would weaken protections for millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams against pesticide runoff and other pollutants.** The proposed reforms would strip away standards that were put in place during the George H.W. Bush administration despite Trump's repeated commitment to "crystal-clean water." Current rules restricts farmers from using land near streams and wetlands for certain kinds of plowing and planting, and also requires permits from the EPA to use some pesticides and fertilizers. Trump's new plan would lift those restrictions.

3/ **John Kelly will remain as chief of staff through at least Jan. 2** to ensure "a very peaceful and pragmatic transition," Kellyanne Conway said. Trump previously announced that Kelly would exit by the end of the year.

* **After Nick Ayers declined the chief of staff job, Trump asks "why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington."** Trump later claimed that "a lot of friends of mine want it," and "we're in no rush." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/11/trump-media-chief-of-staff-search-1055434) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/white-house-hiring-trump.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/10/president-trump-scrambles-next-white-house-chief-staff/2267864002/))

* **Trump's mood after Ayers' declined the job: "super pissed" and humiliated**. Trump has also become increasingly concerned about what his administration is up against come January, when Democrats are expected to exercise their oversight powers on the Trump administration.

4/ **Trump sees impeachment as a "real possibility" after prosecutors in New York linked him to campaign finance violations** for directing the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. The legal troubles have unnerved some of his fellow Republicans with one official calling last week's court filings a "reality tremor." ([CNN](https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/12/10/politics/trump-impeachment-concern/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/dc558078d0bb4b3e8aec63960a7091f0) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-political-legal-problems-robert-mueller-5c9cb684-23ea-47c8-88e7-243a9bb1ef1e.html))

5/ **Trump continues to reject the assessment U.S. spy agencies lay out for him in daily briefings on world events**. In particular, Trump has dismissed the intelligence community's assessments about Russia's interference in the 2016 election, North Korea's willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program, Iran's nuclear and regional ambitions, the existence of climate change, and the role of the Saudi crown prince in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
