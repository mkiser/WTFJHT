1/ **The government shutdown enters day 21 as Congress left for the weekend after another round of negotiations to end the stalemate failed** – ensuring that the partial government shutdown will become the longest in history. The House and Senate, however, both passed a measure to ensure that federal workers who are furloughed receive back pay once the government reopens, which now goes to Trump for his signature. The House also passed another bill that to reopen more government departments, but the is likely DOA in the Senate because of a veto threat from Trump. The second-longest shutdown stretched for 21 days from December 1995 until January 1996, due to a dispute between Bill Clinton and the Republican-led Congress at the time.

2/ **An estimated 800,000 federal employees missed their first paycheck due to the shutdown**. In particular, more than 24,000 FAA employees, including air traffic controllers, are working without pay, since their positions are considered vital for "life and safety," and more than 17,000 other have been furloughed – told to stop doing their jobs.

* **Federal crop payments have stopped flowing to farmers**, who say they cannot get federally backed operating loans to buy seed for their spring planting, or feed for their livestock because of the shutdown. Farmers also can't look up government data about beef prices or soybean yields to make decisions about planting and selling their goods. Some farmers have said the loss of loans, payments and other services has pushed them to a breaking point. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/farmers-trump-administration.html))

* **The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has curtailed inspections due to the shutdown**, while the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has suspended health exposure assessments. Cash assistance to buy groceries are funded through February. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/government-shutdown-food-safety-fda-donald-trump))

3/ **The Trump administration is laying the groundwork to declare a national emergency and possibly use a portion of the Army's $13.9 billion disaster fund to pay for his border wall**. The money is meant to fund civil works projects, including to repair storm-damaged areas of Puerto Rico through 2020. Jared Kushner, meanwhile, has urged Trump to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency, but said an emergency should be invoked only if it creates a clear path for the White House to build the wall. Democrats are exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge a possible national emergency declaration.

* ***UPDATE*****: Trump said he is not looking to declare a national emergency "right now" for his border wall**, a day after suggesting he would "probably" do so. Trump instead urged "Congress to do its job" and vote, again, on funding for the wall. Yesterday, Trump claimed his lawyers had told him that a national emergency declaration – allowing him to bypass Democrats in Congress – would hold up to legal scrutiny "100%." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-prepares-to-break-for-weekend-all-but-ensuring-longest-shutdown-in-us-history/2019/01/11/7f6e88c8-15bb-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/trump-national-emergency-border-wall-shutdown))

4/ **Trump falsely denied that he ever promised that Mexico would "write out a check" for his border wall**, except he did: at least 212 times during the campaign and more since taking office. In a March 2016 memo, Trump outlined that Mexico would "make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion" for the wall. Trump has more recently resorted to a baseless claim that Mexico will now indirectly pay for the wall through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which has not been ratified by Congress, and contains no provisions earmarking money for the wall.

3. **Rudy Giuliani thinks Trump's legal team should be allowed to "correct" Robert Mueller's final report** before Congress or the American people get the chance to read it. Giuliani went on to call it "a matter of fairness," because the special counsel "could be wrong."
