1/ **The Senate will vote on a pair of competing proposals to reopen the government** and end the partial shutdown, which is now in its 34th day. Both are expected to fail with no clear consensus between Democrats and Republicans over how to end the longest shutdown in US history. The first vote will be on a Republican-backed proposal to allocate $5.7 billion for Trump's border wall. The second vote will be on a Democratic-backed proposal to temporarily reopen the shuttered government agencies without providing any money for a wall. Both are expected to fall short of the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. The votes are slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET.

2/ **Trump won't deliver his State of the Union address during the shutdown after all**, capitulating to Nancy Pelosi, who vowed not to pass a "concurrent resolution authorizing the president's State of the Union address in the House chamber until government has opened." The White House was reportedly caught off-guard by Pelosi's statement, leaving officials scrambling for a response. Officials also worried that a campaign-style rally wouldn't be formal enough for the traditional speech, and that Trump is prone to veer off message during a rally. The other reason: TV networks might not carry the rally live. Trump instead tweeted that he will wait until the shutdown is over because nowhere could compete with the "history and tradition" of the House chamber. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, meanwhile, called Trump's decision to concede to Pelosi a "bad decision."

3/ **Trump's commerce secretary doesn't "really quite understand why" unpaid federal workers are going food banks when they could take out low-interest loans** from banks and credit unions to cover their bills. The suggestion by Wilbur Ross comes as roughly 800,000 unpaid federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck due to the shutdown. Chuck Schumer called Ross' comments "unreal" while Pelosi characterized them as a "let-them-eat-cake attitude."

* **Air traffic controllers' union: "We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play**, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break." Union leaders said staffing at air traffic control facilities was at a "30-year low" as employees continue to callout.

* **John Kelly and four other former Homeland Security secretaries called on Trump to end the shutdown on national security grounds.** Kelly, along with Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, and Jeh Johnson sent a joint letter to Trump calling on him "to restore the funding necessary to ensure our homeland remains safe and that the Department's critical national security functions continue without compromise."

4/ **The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for Michael Cohen to testify in mid-February** after he delayed his public testimony before the House Oversight Committee over alleged "ongoing threats against his family from President Trump" and members of his legal team. Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, said his client "will honor the subpoena." It is not clear if the House Oversight and Intelligence committees will also issue subpoenas for Cohen, who is expected to begin serving a three-year prison term in early March. Trump weighed in on Twitter, calling Cohen a "bad lawyer."

## Notables.

1. **Russia warned the U.S. against launching a military intervention in Venezuela** after Juan Guaido declared himself interim president in a coup d'etat and Trump threatened to use the "full weight" of U.S. economic and diplomatic power to stabilize the country. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela "would be a catastrophic scenario that would shake the foundations of the development model which we see in Latin America."
