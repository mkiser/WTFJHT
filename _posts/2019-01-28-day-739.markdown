1/ **The partial shutdown – the longest in U.S. history – ended Friday with Trump agreeing to temporarily reopen the government without money for his wall**. Trump, however, is threatening to shut down the government again in less than three weeks if Congress can't reach a deal to fund the wall, because he doesn't believe negotiators will strike a deal he could accept. According to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump will secure border "with or without Congress." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/shutdown-congress-trump-wall.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-will-secure-border-with-or-without-congress-mulvaney-says/2019/01/27/6f887ba6-223d-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-to-debate-border-immigration-as-next-shutdown-threat-looms-11548614760))

2/ **The shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, with an estimated $3 billion in economic activity permanently lost**. the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected economic growth will slow this year to 2.3%, compared with the 3.1% rate last year, as the benefits of the new tax law begin to fade. Separately, the National Association of Business Economics found that the $1.5 trillion cut tax package has had no major impact on businesses' capital investment or hiring plans. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/28/government-shutdown-cost-the-economy-11-billion-cbo.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-investment-idUSKCN1PM0B0) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/28/us-economy-expected-grow-by-percent-cbo-says-slowdown-fears-mount/))

3/ **Trump's golf course in New York relied on a dozen undocumented workers while Trump was demanded border wall funding during the shutdown**. They were fired midway through the government shutdown. The firings at the New York golf club follow a report from last year about an undocumented worker at Trump's Bedminster golf club in New Jersey. After that story, the company fired the undocumented workers. Trump still owns his businesses, but has given day-to-day control to Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

* **📌 [Day 686](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/12/06/day-686/): An undocumented immigrant has worked as a maid at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013 using fake documents to secure employment**. After Trump became president, one of her managers told her to get both a new green card and new Social Security card because there were problems with her current ones. When she told the manager that she did not know how to obtain new forgeries, her manager suggested she speak with a maintenance employee to acquire new documents. Her manager lent her the money to replace the one that had "expired." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/trump-bedminster-golf-undocumented-workers.html))

Emma Torres told a human resources employee that she did not have legal status. The woman replied: "'It's O.K. No problem.' She scratched me off the list." Torres later made sandwiches for Secret Service agents when they began visiting the property.

## ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration lifted sanctions against three companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.** The Treasury Department originally sanctioned Deripaska, six other oligarchs, and their companies in April in response to Russia's "malign activity" around the world. The sanctions against Deripaska himself will remain in effect, but his companies launched a lobbying campaign to argue that the sanctions against aluminum giant Rusal would disrupt the aluminum market and damage U.S. companies. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-idUSKCN1PL0S1) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions-deripaska.html) / [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanctions-against-3-russian-companies-linked-to-oleg-deripaska-lifted-by-us) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-27/u-s-treasury-lifts-sanctions-on-three-deripaska-companies))

2. **Roger Stone didn't rule out cooperating with Robert Mueller, despite repeatedly pledging his loyalty to Trump**. Stone said he'd "have to determine after my attorneys have some discussion" about cooperating with Mueller. He added: "If there's wrongdoing by other people in the campaign that I know about, which I know of none, but if there is I would certainly testify honestly." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roger-stone-longtime-president-donald-trump-friend-veteran/story?id=60646251) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKCN1PL0PQ) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roger-stone-says-he-would-consider-cooperating-with-mueller-probe-11548606140))

3. **Jerome Corsi, a longtime friend and associate of Stone, said the indictment against Stone is "accurate"** and that he will be "happy" to "affirm that if asked to in court." Corsi was identified as "Person 1" in the 24-page federal indictment filed by Mueller against Stone. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/jerome-corsi-indictment-roger-stone-cnntv/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/27/jerome-corsi-roger-stone-mueller-investigation-1128618))

4. **Trump and Jared Kushner thought firing Michael Flynn would end the "Russia thing,"** according to Chris Christie's forthcoming book, "Let Me Finish." Christie recalled that Trump told him "this Russia thing is all over now, because I fired Flynn." Trump went on to explain that "Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It's over." Kushner added: "That's right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/chris-christie-book-trump.html))

5. **American and Taliban officials have agreed in principle on a framework for a peace deal in Afghanistan.** The framework includes a guarantee that the Taliban will prevent Afghan territory from being used by terrorists in exchange for a ceasefire and Taliban talks with the Afghan government. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/world/asia/taliban-peace-deal-afghanistan.html))

## 🧐 So Presidential.

1. **Hillary Clinton isn't "closing the doors to the idea of running in 2020."** In October, Clinton said she wasn't planning on running, but has reportedly told people "as recently as this week" that she would "like to be president." ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/427156-clinton-not-ruling-out-running-in-2020-report))

2. **Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz tweeted that he is "seriously thinking of running for president" as an independent**. The billionaire's announcement was mocked by people pointing out that there were better ways of helping the country with his money than by jumping in the race and helping Trump win re-election. Trump tweeted that Schultz "doesn't have the 'guts' to be president." ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/howard-schultz-starbucks-ceo-considering-independent-run-for-president-60-minutes/) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/howard-schultzs-2020-presidential-flirtation-brutalized-on-twitter) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/trump-howard-schultz-2020-elections-1128701))
