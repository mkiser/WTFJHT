1/ **Paul Manafort "repeatedly and brazenly" broke the law and the "crimes he engaged in while on bail were not minor; they went to the heart of the criminal justice system," according Robert Mueller's 800-page court filing.** Manafort's sentence should reflect the "gravity of his conduct," prosecutors wrote in the unsealed filing, which includes a note from Mueller indicating that federal sentencing guidelines suggest Manafort should receive a sentence of 17 to 22 years in prison. Mueller also said Manafort engaged in a "bold" string of criminal actions and an extensive pattern of deceit that "remarkably went unabated even after indictment."

2/ **Trump asked his outside legal team to stay on after the Mueller probe ends** to help with the Southern District of New York investigation, which Trump's close allies consider a far graver threat than Mueller. Trump Jr., meanwhile, dismissed both the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York probe, claiming that Trump, the Trump Organization, and the Trump family "don't appear all that worried, because we know there's nothing there." Separately, the Trump Organization asked the House Judiciary Committee to stop its investigations related to the company, claiming a conflict of interest because the panel hired a lawyer whose firm once represented Trump's company.

* **House Intelligence Committee will subpoena the special counsel's final report and compel Mueller to testify if the full report is not given to Congress.** During his confirmation hearing last month, William Barr said he would be "provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law" when it comes to releasing the Mueller report. "We will obviously subpoena the report," Adam Schiff said. "We will bring Bob Mueller in to testify before Congress; we will take it to court if necessary. And in the end, I think the (Justice) Department understands they’re going to have to make this public."

* **Michael Cohen will be questioned by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday**. Cohen will not be questioned about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election or about possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he is expected to be questioned about Trump's "debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election" and his "compliance with campaign finance laws."

3/ **A bipartisan group of 58 former national security officials will issue a joint statement denouncing Trump's national emergency declaration.** "There is no factual basis" for Trump to proclaim a national emergency in order to build his border wall, the statement says. The statement comes a day before the House is expected to vote on a measure to block Trump's declaration. Trump, meanwhile, warned Republican senators to not "get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security."

4/ **The White House will select a group of federal scientists to challenge the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions and burning of fossil fuels are driving global warming**. The panel is an initiative of the National Security Council and will not be subject to the same level of public disclosure as formal advisory committees, which are required meet in public, are subject to public records requests, and require representative membership. ([Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/white-house-to-select-federal-scientists-to-reassess-government-climate-findings-sources-say/2019/02/24/49cd0a84-37dd-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html))

Trump added that he is in "no rush" to see North Korea denuclearize.
