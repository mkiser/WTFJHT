1/ **Otto Warmbier's family blamed Kim Jong Un for the death of their son a day after Trump said he took Kim "at his word" that the North Korean dictator was not responsible**. Fred and Cindy Warmbier called Kim the leader of an "evil regime" that is "responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity" that resulted in Warmbier death in 2017. Warmbier was arrested for taking a propaganda banner from a hotel in Pyongyang in January 2016 and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was released in a coma after 17 months and died days later.

* **The North Korean delegation to the Trump-Kim summit disputed Trump's claim that Kim demanded that the U.S. lift all sanctions in order for North Korea to move forward with denuclearization.** "Basically," Trump said yesterday, "they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn't do that. We had to walk away from that." Hours later, two top officials from the North Korean delegation told reporters Kim had only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for shutting down their main nuclear complex. An anonymous senior U.S. official acknowledged that Kim only wanted the U.N. Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed since March 2016, and did not include sanctions from the previous decade.
