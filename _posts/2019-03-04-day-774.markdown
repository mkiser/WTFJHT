1/ **The House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by Trump and his administration**. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler sent letters demanding documents from more than 80 family members, business associates, political confidants, and entities tied to Trump, including the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign, the Trump Foundation, the presidential inaugural committee, the White House, Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, the National Rifle Association, and others. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over impeachment, and any hearings that explore whether Trump committed "high crimes and misdemeanors" would take place before the panel.

* **House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says there is "direct evidence" of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.** Schiff said the evidence can be found "in the emails from the Russians through their intermediary offering dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of what is described in writing as the Russian government effort to help elect Donald Trump." Schiff says the Russians offered dirt on Clinton and that "\[t\]here is an acceptance of that offer in writing from the president’s son, Don Jr., and there is overt acts and furtherance of that."

* **House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the hush money payments made by Michael Cohen to women on behalf of Trump "aren't impeachable" offenses**. McCarthy downplayed the significance of the payments and referred to the campaign finance violations as mere fines. "I watched — this is a — if it’s a finance campaign, those are fines," McCarthy said. "Those aren’t impeachable in the process." He added that other politicians have done "this exact same thing in the past."

2/ **Mitch McConnell expects the resolution to overturn Trump's emergency declaration to pass in the Republican-led Senate – but not survive a veto by Trump** – after Rand Paul became the fourth Republican to announce he would vote for the disapproval resolution.

Trump promised to veto the resolution if it reaches his desk, which would be the first veto of his presidency. Neither the House nor the Senate have the votes needed to override a presidential veto.

Trump called Cohn, then the director of the National Economic Council, into the Oval Office along with John Kelly and said to Kelly: "I've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing's happened! I've mentioned it fifty times. And nothing's happened. I want to make sure it's filed. I want that deal blocked!"

## Notables.

1. **Roger Stone suggested he has been "framed" by Robert Mueller in an Instagram post**, possibly violating the gag order barring him from criticizing the prosecutors in the criminal case against him. Stone published the post less than 48 hours after Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered his lawyers to explain why they didn't tell her about the planned publication of a book by Stone that could violate her gag order on him. On Feb. 15, Stone said on Instagram that his book, "The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Trump Really Won," would be published March 1. Digital versions of the book have been on sale since Feb. 19, however.
