1/ **Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump used WhatsApp and personal email accounts to conduct official government business**, according to Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In a letter, Cummings accused the White House of "obstructing the committee's investigation into allegations of violations of federal records laws" and potential breaches of national security. He said he'd give the White House a final chance to "voluntarily" comply with his investigation into the use of private email accounts by Kushner, Ivanka, and other White House officials before resorting to "alternative means" to obtain the information requested. Kushner's lawyer told the committee in December that his client had used WhatsApp for official business, but that he was not in violation of the Presidential Records Act because he took screenshots of his communications and forwarded them to his White House email account or to the National Security Council. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/17/politics/jared-kushner-saudi-ties-jamal-khashoggi/index.html) and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-big-bet-on-saudis-now-poses-a-bigger-dilemma-1540402173) previously reported that Kushner had communicated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman using WhatsApp. The panel also obtained documents showing that former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland and Steve Bannon conducted official business using personal accounts.

2/ **The former owner of a Florida spa involved in a prostitution investigation claimed she didn't sell access to Trump.** Cindy Yang  says the allegations that she is a Chinese agent are false, and that she believes she is being persecuted because of her ethnicity and political party. "I'm Chinese. I'm Republican," she said. "That's the reason the Democrats want to check me." She also said that she hasn't had any contact with members of the Chinese government since she moved to the United States 20 years ago.

3/ **Trump wants Patriots owner Robert Kraft at the White House celebrating the team's Super Bowl victory despite Kraft's recent arrest on charges of soliciting prostitution at a Florida massage parlor**.

5/ **Trump is expected to sign an executive order today regarding free speech on college campuses.** Trump cited complaints by conservatives who allege their views are suppressed on campuses, and that speakers are sometimes assaulted or silenced when protesters threaten violence. Earlier this month, Trump said he would issue an executive order "requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars." Details about the policy and how it would work remain unclear. The White House says Trump will sign the order and make a statement about "improving free inquiry, transparency and accountability on campus" this afternoon.

## Notables.

1. **There is no longer a single Republican in the House that is considered a supporter of abortion rights**, following the retirements of Charlie Dent and Rodney Frelinghuysen.

([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-republicans-now-unanimous-in-opposing-abortion-rights-11553172954))

2. **U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has reportedly released hundreds of migrants from detention facilities along the southern border in Texas due to severe overcrowding**. At least 250 migrants were released on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials say the releases are necessary due to the recent influx of migrants from Central America. Immigrant advocates said the releases are meant to sow confusion at the border to help make the case for Trump's national emergency declaration.

3. **The Florida man who sent pipe bombs to Trump's political enemies is set to plead guilty in Manhattan federal court today.** Cesar Sayoc's change-of-plea hearing was made public last week after a conference call between prosecutors, a judge, and Sayoc's attorneys. By pleading guilty, Sayoc will avoid his trial, which was scheduled for July. Sayoc has been held without bail since he was arrested in late October outside of a South Florida auto parts store. Absent a plea deal, Sayoc could face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-man-who-sent-pipe-bombs-to-media-trump-critics-set-to-plead-guilty/))
