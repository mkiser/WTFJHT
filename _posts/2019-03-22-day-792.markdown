1/ **Trump warned that "people will not stand for it" if Robert Mueller's report makes him look bad**. Trump – again – complained that "a deputy, that didn't get any votes, appoints a man that didn't get any votes," referring to Rod Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller. Trump also bemoaned that Mueller was "best friend" with James Comey, who succeeded Mueller as FBI director, despite there being no evidence that the two are close friends.

* **📌 [Day 790](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/03/20/day-790/#1-trump-called-muellers-report-illeg): Trump called Mueller's report illegitimate because he was never elected and complained to reporters that he now has to deal with "somebody writing a report" despite having "won one of the greatest elections of all time."** Trump went on to refer to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as just "a deputy" who was "appointed," who then "appoint\[ed\] another man to write a report," rhetorically asking somebody to "explain that, because my voters don't get it, and I don't get it." Trump nominated Rosenstein, who was confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate in a 94-6 vote.

* **In June, Rosenstein sent a 12-page letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley outlining a potential road map on what to expect from Mueller**. Rosenstein made it clear that he believes the Justice Department will not include disparaging or incriminating information about anybody who has not been charged with a crime. Translation: Don't expect a criticism of Trump or any associates if they have not been charged with crimes.

2/ **The Democratic chairs of the six House committees will direct the Justice Department, FBI, and White House Counsel's Office to preserve records provided to Mueller after he submits his report to William Barr**. The effort will ensure that agencies comply with the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act to retain correspondence, memos, reports and other material should the committees request them. House Democrats have also discussed issuing subpoenas for the information if the White House refuses to cooperate.

3/ **Trump called for his attorney general to "do what's fair" and open investigations into Hillary Clinton, Comey, James Clapper, and James Brennan.** Providing no evidence to support his claims, Trump asserted that he's been treated "very unfairly" by Mueller's team, while "nobody does anything" about all the "stone cold crimes" committed by former Obama officials. Trump also accused Comey, Clapper, and Brennan of telling "absolute lies" to Congress. Trump went on to call it an "interesting question" as to whether he thought Attorney General William Barr should look into his accusations.

4/ **Trump cancelled sanctions aimed at North Korea a day after they were imposed by his own Treasury Department**. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump removed the sanctions because he "likes" North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. [Yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/trump-north-korea-china-sanctions.html), the Treasury Department announced new sanctions against two Chinese shipping companies for their alleged role in evading U.N. sanctions against North Korea. A former director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury called it "utterly shocking" that Trump would "actively undercut his own sanctions agency for the benefit of North Korea." Trump announced his decision via [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109143448634966020).

## Notables.

1. **The commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps warned that sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and funding transfers under Trump's emergency declaration has posed "unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency."** Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller wrote two internal memos that said the "unplanned/unbudgeted" deployment order by Trump last fall along the southwest border, along with shifts in other funds to support border security operations, have forced him to cancel or reduce other military training in at least five countries and delay urgent base repairs.

A replacement to fill the top White House trade position is still in the works, but nothing has been finalized.
