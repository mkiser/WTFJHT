1/ **Senior Trump administration officials overturned and granted at least 25 security clearances – including two current senior White House officials – to people who were initially denied** by career employees for "serious disqualifying issues" in their backgrounds. Tricia Newbold, a whistleblower working in the White House Personnel Security Office, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that she warned her superiors that clearances "were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security." Newbold claims she was retaliated again for declining to issue security clearances, including being suspended without pay for 14 days.

2/ **The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote to authorize subpoenas to obtain Robert Mueller's full report**. Attorney General William Barr pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-April. Chairman Jerry Nadler, however, wants the "full and complete report," which spans nearly 400 pages, as well as underlying evidence. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-judiciary-plans-vote-this-week-to-subpoena-muellers-report/2019/04/01/411e24a6-5469-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/01/politics/house-judiciary-subpoena-full-muller-report/index.html))

3/ **Trump called the 2020 census "meaningless" if it doesn't include a citizenship question that two federal judges have already ruled against**. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add the citizenship question violated federal law by June. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-census-would-be-meaningless-without-citizenship-question/2019/04/01/81e59ba2-5475-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/01/trump-census-citizenship-1246499) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-census/trump-says-u-s-census-meaningless-without-citizenship-question-idUSKCN1RD2DS))

4/ **Trump plans to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign assistance programs for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador**. Democrats called the move "short-sighted and flawed," "reckless," and "counterproductive" to reducing the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. The move affects nearly $500 million in 2018 funds earmarked for Central America but has not yet been spent.

5/ **The White House reiterated Trump's threat to close the U.S. border with Mexico**, despite warnings that the move would do little to slow migrants trying to enter the U.S. "It certainly isn't a bluff," Kellyanne Conway said. "You can take the president seriously." Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner and closing the border would cause immediate economic damage. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-white-house-doubles-down-on-threat-to-close-us-mexico-border/2019/03/31/bd2e070a-53c9-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-threat-close-border-certainly-isn-t-bluff-conway-n989341))
