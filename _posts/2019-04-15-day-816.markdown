1/ **Attorney General William Barr will release a redacted version of Robert Mueller's report to both Congress and the public on Thursday morning**. The redactions will cover four categories: secret grand jury details, classified national security and intelligence specifics, material related to ongoing investigations and sections that could defame "peripheral" third parties wraped up in Mueller's probe. The release comes days after Barr told Congress he believed "spying" on the Trump campaign occurred during the 2016 election. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have already authorized the use of a subpoena to compel the Justice Department for the full report without redactions if they do not receive it this week.

2/ **The House Intelligence Committee demands that Mueller "must" brief them and provide "all materials, regardless of form and classification, obtained or produced" during his 2-year investigation**. Chairman Adam Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes requested that Mueller and other senior members of his team brief the committee, in a letter sent March 27th to Barr, FBI Director Chris Wray, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Nunes has previously dismissed the Mueller report as a "partisan document" that he has no interest in reading.

4/ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that members of Congress aren't "smart enough" to understand Trump's tax returns**. Earlier this month, the House Ways and Means Committee formally requested Trump's tax returns from the IRS, setting a hard deadline of April 23 to comply. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the request "lack[s] merit."

5/ **The White House is considering travel restrictions for nationals of countries with high rates of overstaying visas as part of a broader push to curb immigration**.

6/ **Trump reportedly revived the rejected proposal to send undocumented immigrants into "sanctuary cities" in order to distract from the Mueller report**, according to people close to him. After members of his administration dismissed the idea of sending migrants to sanctuary cities, Trump tweeted that he was still considering the plan. Further, Trump has reportedly been "purposefully escalating his language" to rile up his base of supporters and anger political rivals, despite previously claiming that Barr's four-page summary of the Mueller report proved there was "No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/trump-mueller-report.html))

7/ **Trump tweeted a video of the World Trade Center towers burning interspersed with remarks Rep. Ilhan Omar made about civil rights and Muslims in America**. "WE WILL NEVER FORGET!" Trump captioned the video. During a speech at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Omar said Muslims have "lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen" since the Sept. 11 attacks, because "some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."

Sarah Sanders, meanwhile, said "it's a good thing the president is calling her out" for her "absolutely abhorrent" comments she made at the event. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/14/politics/ilhan-omar-death-threats/index.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/14/ilhan-omar-trump-9-11-september) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/15/this-is-endangering-lives-it-has-stop-rep-ilhan-omar-says-death-threats-spiked-after-trump-tweet/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ilhan-omar-death-threats-increased-since-trumps-twin-towers-tweet/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-calling-rep-ilhan-omar-comments-good/story?id=62384114))

9/ **Nancy Pelosi demanded that Trump delete "his disrespectful and dangerous video" of Omar**, claiming his "hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger." Pelosi added that the U.S. Capitol Police and the House sergeant-at-arms "are conducting a security assessment to safeguard" Omar. "They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces."
