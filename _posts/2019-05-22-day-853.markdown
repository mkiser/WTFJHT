So get these phony investigations over with."

2/ **The IRS must honor congressional requests for Trump's tax returns unless Trump invokes executive privilege to protect them**, according to a confidential draft legal memo written by IRS staffers. The memo undercuts Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's argument that the White House doesn't have to comply with Congress' requests because they lack any "legitimate legislative purpose." Mnuchin said he came to that conclusion after consulting with attorneys from the Treasury Department, the IRS, and the Justice Department, but the memo says the Treasury Secretary does not have the authority to deny requests for taxpayer returns made by tax-writing committees in Congress.

3/ **The House Intelligence Committee reached a last-minute deal with the Justice Department over the redacted material in the Mueller report and will not enforce the subpoena against Attorney General William Barr.** The DOJ agreed to produce the redacted material and the underlying information from the special counsel's report that the committee requested, but committee chairman Adam Schiff said the subpoena "will remain in effect and will be enforced should the Department fail to comply with the full document request." Schiff said he expects the DOJ to finish turning over the 12 categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence material from Mueller's report "by the end of next week." In a letter sent to Schiff on Tuesday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd warned that "the Department will not likely be able to continue to work with the Committee to accommodate its interest in these materials" if the committee takes "the precipitous and unnecessary action of recommending a contempt finding or other enforcement action against the attorney general."

Five search warrants filed by Mueller's office starting that July were unsealed in federal court on Wednesday, providing more insight into the early suspicions held by investigators on Mueller's team. The exchanges between Cohen and Andrew Intrater of Columbus Nova LLC began the day Trump was elected, and Mueller's team was investigating whether payments to Cohen from Columbus Nova were connected to a plan to give Michael Flynn a proposal to lift sanctions against Russia. No charges were filed related to that particular inquiry. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-22/michael-cohen-filings-show-950-messages-with-oligarch-s-cousin))
