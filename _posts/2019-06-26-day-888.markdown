1/ **Robert Mueller agreed to testify before the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees in back-to-back public hearings on July 17th** about his investigation into Russia's election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The announcement came after the two panels issued a subpoena compelling Mueller's testimony. Mueller previously said he did not want to testify and his report should serve as his testimony. Members of Mueller's team will also participate in a closed-door session with lawmakers.

2/ **Trump attacked Mueller and accused him ‚Äì without evidence ‚Äì of committing a crime** after House Democrats announced that Mueller would testify publicly next month. Trump claimed that Mueller "terminated" FBI communications by deleting text messages exchanged by two former FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. "And that's illegal," Trump tweeted. "That's a crime." Trump was referring to a Justice Department inspector general report that it could not recover texts from the phones assigned to Strzok and Page, because by the time investigators requested the devices, they had been reset for others to use them. Trump referred to Strzok and Page as "pathetic lovers" for having had an affair.

3/ **The House Oversight Committee authorized a subpoena for Kellyanne Conway after she failed to show for a hearing about her alleged violations of the Hatch Act**, a law that limits federal employees‚Äô political activity. Special counsel Henry Kerner said Conway should be fired for blatantly and repeatedly violating the Hatch Act. The White House blocked Conway from testifying about allegations of repeated violations of the Hatch Act. Chairman Elijah Cummings warned that the committee would vote to hold Conway in contempt if she ignores the subpoena.

4/ **The House approved a $4.5 billion aid package for the southwestern border**. The 230-195 vote was mostly along party lines, with all but four Democrats supporting bill. Even if the two chambers are able to reach an agreement, it's unclear if Trump will sign it into law. Democrats will now have to begin negotiations with Senate GOP leaders in order to get the aid package signed into law before the weeklong recess.

5/ **Trump complained that congressional Democrats "won't do anything at all about border security" hours after the House passed the aid package** to address the humanitarian crisis at the southern border. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/trump-border-security-bill-1382995))
