1/ **Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to "do us a favor" and "look into" potential corruption by Joe Biden's son**, according to the White House readout of the July 25th call. Trump told Zelensky he'd have Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Guiliani contact him so Ukraine could "figure it out" and "get to the bottom of it." Trump, before asking Ukraine to investigate Biden's son, reminded Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election as it related to Ukraine, as well as to investigate whether he could locate a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server that contained some of Hillary Clinton's emails. After the whistlerblower complaint raising concerns about Trump's call with Zelensky, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community each referred the complaint for a possible criminal investigation into Trump's actions. While there was no explicit reference to the $391 million in foreign aid that Trump directed Mick Mulvaney to block days before the call took place, the intelligence community's inspector general told the Director of National Intelligence that Trump's comments could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of federal campaign finance laws. The Justice Department, however, concluded that it "could not make out a criminal campaign finance violation" based on the summary of the call. Officials, however, didn't take into consideration that Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine at the time. The document, which the White House and Trump refer to as a transcript, isn't verbatim – it's a "memorandum of telephone conversation" based off the "notes and recollections" of Situation Room and National Security Council officials.

2/ **The White House released the whistleblower complaint against Trump to the House and the Senate intelligence committees**, according to Richard Burr and Devin Nunes. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, had until now blocked Congress from seeing the complaint. Separately, White House officials are working with intelligence officials on a deal to allow the whistleblower to speak with congressional investigators.

3/ **The acting Director of National Intelligence threatened to resign if he was not allowed to testify freely before Congress** on Thursday about the whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's conduct according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Joseph Maguire warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, forcing the White House to make a legal decision on whether it was going to assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint. McGuire later denied reports that he threatened to resign, saying that "at no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019." The White House also disputed the account.

4/ **The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Attorney General William Barr to recuse himself from overseeing any Justice Department's involvement from any Ukraine-related investigations**. "The President dragged the Attorney General into this mess," Jerry Nadler tweeted. "At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter." ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/462985-nadler-calls-on-ag-barr-to-recuse-himself-from-ukraine-matter) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-barr/house-judiciary-chief-call-on-barr-to-recuse-himself-from-ukraine-probes-idUSKBN1WA24K) / [The Week](https://theweek.com/speedreads/867595/house-judiciary-chair-nadler-demands-attorney-general-barr-recuse-himself-after-ukraine-transcript-release))

5/ **Trump called Nancy Pelosi shortly after she announced the start of a formal impeachment proceeding to see if they could "figure this out"**. Pelosi [replied](https://twitter.com/HeidiNBC/status/1176631973361704960): "Tell your people to obey the law." Trump also told Pelosi that he wasn't responsible for the whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress.

* **How impeachment works**:  Congress can remove presidents before their term is up if lawmakers vote that they committed "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." The House Judiciary Committee – or a special panel – investigates and determines whether to recommended articles of impeachment to the full House. The House then votes on articles of impeachment and if a majority vote to impeach, the president is then impeached – the equivalent of being indicted. The Senate will then hold a trial, which is overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Lawmakers from the House are prosecutors, the president has defense lawyers, and the Senate serves as the jury. If at least two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, he is removed, and the vice president takes over as president. There is no appeal.

6/ **The White House accidentally emailed House Democrats a list of proposed talking points intended for Trump allies about how to spin Trump's July phone call with Zelensky**. The White House then emailed Democrats a follow-up email recalling the message.

7/  **Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the U.N. General Assembly today in New York**. The pre-planned meeting with Zelensky comes less than 24 hours after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry. Senior White House officials said Trump is planning to congratulate Zelensky on his latest election win and his "energy and success" so far when it comes to fighting corruption in Ukraine. Trump is also expected to bring up "his concerns about what he sees as some predatory Chinese economic activity in Ukraine."

## Notables.

1. **The Senate voted – again – to block Trump's national emergency declaration to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to build his proposed border wall**. The Senate voted 54-41 – short of the two-thirds majority needed to overcome Trump's likely veto. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-25/senate-votes-again-to-block-trump-s-border-emergency-wall-fund) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/senate-votes-to-block-trump-national-emergency-over-border-wall.html))

2. **The Trump administration signed a deal with Honduras to force immigrants to first seek asylum there before coming to America**, regardless of whether they're seeking help from the U.S. under international torture agreements or the asylum system. The agreement is similar to the one made with El Salvador and Guatemala. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/25/20883831/trump-asylum-honduras-agreement))

3. **A Trump administration proposal could end free school lunches for about 500,000 children**. The change would limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps, cutting an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.
