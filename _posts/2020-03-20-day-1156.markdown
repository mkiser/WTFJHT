1/ **Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators, as well as senior Trump administration officials kicked off talks on a $1 trillion economic stabilization plan** – the third stimulus package Congress has considered this month to confront the coronavirus –  with the goal of having a deal by the end of the day. Mitch McConnell has promised to pass the new stimulus though the chamber by Monday despite multiple disagreements over the structure of the bill, which was released Thursday. The initial plan would have given many Americans $1,200 in a one-time payment, but those without federal tax liability – i.e. the poorest Americans – would get as little as $600. Trump has also promised that the initial payment would be substantially higher than $1,000.

3/ **Trump attacked a reporter on live TV who asked what his message would be to Americans who are frightened by the coronavirus pandemic**. Trump responded by calling Peter Alexander, an NBC News correspondent, “a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. I think it’s a very nasty question and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people.” Moments earlier during the coronavirus task force's daily briefing, Trump’s director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said any evidence about drug therapies being tested was “anecdotal” and not the product of a “clinical trial.” Trump nevertheless said he felt "good" about the treatments and that the federal government had already ordered "millions of units" of them. Later in the briefing, Mike Pence responded to Alexander's question, saying, “do not be afraid, be vigilant” and went on to explain that the risk of serious illness for most Americans is low.

He went on to accuse mainstream media outlets of  "siding with China" and parroting the propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party.

4/ **At least four senators sold off millions of dollars’ worth of stocks just before the market dropped amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic**. Sens. Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler sold off more than a million dollars each in stocks after attending private, senators-only briefings about the severity of the impending coronavirus crisis. Burr, who serves as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had been receiving daily updates from the intelligence community on threats to the U.S., including the coronavirus, before dumped up to $1.56 million on Feb. 13 – days after he wrote an op-ed for Fox News arguing that the U.S. is "better prepared than ever before" when it comes to facing public health threats like COVID-19. Loeffler, who is married to the chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and her husband sold up to $3.1 million in jointly owned stocks starting on Jan. 24 – the same day the Senate Health Committee, on which she sits, briefed senators briefing about the coronavirus. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a member of the intelligence committee, and her husband sold up to $6 million worth of stock in Jan. and Feb. And, Sen. James Inhofe sold as much as $400,000 in January. Burr said he has asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his sale.

* **📌 [Day 1155](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/03/19/day-1155/#1-the-chairman-of-the-senate-intelli): The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee warned constituents three weeks ago to prepare for dire economic and societal effects from the coronavirus**. "There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history," Sen. Richard Burr said on Feb. 27, according to a secret recording of the remarks. "It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic." On that same day, Trump suggested that the virus is "going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle. It will disappear," before adding, "it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens." On Feb 13., Burr sold off between $582,029 and $1.56 million of his holdings despite reassuring the public at the time that the government had the coronavirus outbreak under control. A week later, the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since.

5/ **The Trump administration asked states to hold off on releasing unemployment claims data** before the regularly scheduled national report of weekly U.S. jobless claims.

* **Wall Street had its worst week since 2008** with the Dow erasing the so-called "Trump bump" and closing below where it stood the day before Trump was inaugurated. Stocks have collapsed more than 30% in a month, wiping out trillions in value and ending an 11-year long bull market.

6/ **A federal judge froze a House lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena for six years of Trump’s federal tax records** until an appeals court rules on whether Congress, in a separate case related to Trump's former White House counsel Donald McGahn, can sue to compel executive branch officials to testify. The House sued the administration in July after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to comply with a subpoena for Trump’s business and tax records issued in May.
