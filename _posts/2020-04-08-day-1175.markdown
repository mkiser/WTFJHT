1/ **Trump attacked the World Health Organization and threatened to withhold funding because of its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its criticisms of his own policies**. Trump, seeking to blame the WHO for the same missteps and failures his administration made, accused the group of having “called it wrong \[...\] every aspect of it wrong” and being “China-centric."  After saying that the U.S. would "put a hold on money spent to the WHO – We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it," Trump later denied that he had made those remarks, saying "I’m not saying that I’m going to do it \[...\] I said we’re going to look at it.” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded, saying: "If you want to be exploited and if you want to have many more body bags, then you \[politicize the virus\]. If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/trump-coronavirus-who-funding-deaths-briefing) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/08/829944795/please-don-t-politicize-this-virus-who-head-says-after-trump-threatens-funding) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/who-responds-to-trumps-threat-to-cut-funding.html))

The warning also appeared in the President’s Daily Brief in early January, which would have had to go through weeks of vetting and analysis.

While public health officials have no idea how severe the spread of the disease in the U.S. would be, they told reporters that "It’s not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses." Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate committee that “This is an unprecedented, potentially severe health challenge globally.” The World Health Organization, meanwhile, [warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/world/asia/china-coronavirus-world-health-organization.html) that the world is not ready for a major outbreak.

Intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus by name, saying it had "pandemic potential" if it were "to acquire efficient human-to-human responsibility." The 2019 worldwide threat assessment reported "that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support."

The reports didn’t predict when the virus would hit the U.S. or recommend steps public health officials should take, but it did track the spread of the virus in China and warned that Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.Trump and lawmakers, however, repeatedly played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the virus. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html))

In a Jan. 29 memo, Navarro called for "an immediate travel ban on China." In a second memo on Feb. 23, Navarro urged the Trump administration to immediately begin laying the groundwork for a $3 billion supplemental spending appropriation from Congress. "This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill," the memo reads. Trump waited several weeks after receiving Navarro's memos before taking steps to mitigate the spread of the virus, and later claimed that "nobody could have predicted something like this."

3/ **The Trump administration is exploring ways to return to “normality” and reopen the U.S. economy as "quickly as possible."** Pence and the coronavirus task force are developing medical guidance and criteria to reopen the country as soon as the start of May. The options being discussed vary in scope, from benchmarks for when states can begin easing restrictions to a nationwide "big bang" that Trump previewed on Fox News. Dr. Anthony Fauci, however, said the first condition is a sustained 14-day drop in the number of cases, normal operations returned to hospitals, and widely available testing. He added that  “now is not the time to pull back at all” on social distancing; rather, “it’s the time to intensify.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/politics/donald-trump-economy-big-bang-coronavirus/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/trump-health-team-crafts-plan-to-open-economy-if-virus-crests?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-and-businessesturn-attention-to-eventual-reopeningof-22-trillion-u-s-economy-11586301615) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/pence-fauci-reopen-country-plan-coronavirus-175792) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/coronavirus-mnuchin-expects-new-york-will-take-longer-to-reopen.html))

* **The CDC is expected to change its guidelines for self-isolation to make it easier for those who have been exposed to someone with the coronavirus to return to work if they are asymptomatic**. Under the new guidance, people who are exposed to someone infected would be allowed back on the job if they are asymptomatic, test their temperature twice a day and wear a face mask.

* **Jared Kushner’s task force want to create a national coronavirus surveillance system to give the government a real-time view of where patients are seeking treatment**, for what, and whether hospitals can accommodate them. The proposed national network could help determine which areas of the country can relax social-distancing rules and which should remain vigilant. The prospect of a national database of potentially sensitive health information has prompted concerns about its impact on civil liberties after the coronavirus threat recedes, with some critics comparing it to the Patriot Act enacted after the 9/11 attacks.

4/ **The CDC removed its dosing information for doctors on how to prescribe hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine**, two drugs recommended by Trump to treat the coronavirus. The original guidance – which was based on unattributed anecdotes rather than peer-reviewed science – was crafted after Trump personally pressed officials to make the malaria drugs more widely available, though the drugs had been untested for COVID-19. The CDC guidance. CDC website no longer includes that information, but instead says: “There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19.” Some ICU doctors, meanwhile, report that they've seen no evidence the drugs are helping their sickest patients. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cdcguidance/cdc-removes-unusual-guidance-to-doctors-about-drug-favored-by-trump-idUSKBN21P39R) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/no-miraculous-recovery-some-icu-doctors-say-hydroxychloroquine-isn-t-n1177556))

Peter Navarro's claim set off a debate in the Situation Room with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, who said there was only anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine works against the coronavirus and more data is needed to prove that it's effective. Navarro, an economist by training, shot back that the information he had collected was “science," claiming his "qualifications \[...\] is that I'm a social scientist." Navarro later said Dr. Fauci's caution about the effectiveness of an anti-malaria drug warrants a "second opinion." Separately, Trump personally pressed federal health officials in mid-March to make chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine available to treat the coronavirus, though they had been untested for COVID-19. Shortly afterward, the federal government published guidance informing doctors they had the option to prescribe the drugs, with dosing information based on unattributed anecdotes rather than peer-reviewed science.
