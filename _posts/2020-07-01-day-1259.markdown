1/ **The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus deaths is "a substantial undercount" of the true tally**, according to researchers at Yale University. Researchers found that the 781,000 total deaths in the U.S. from March 1 through May 30 were about 19% higher than what would normally be expected. And, the number of excess deaths from any cause were 28% higher than the official tally of U.S. COVID-19 deaths during those months. In 45 states, seven-day averages of new infections are higher than they were a week ago and more than 800,000 new cases were reported in the U.S. in June — led by Florida, Arizona Texas and California. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, warned that some countries might have to reimplement lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

3/ **The Federal Reserve raised concerns in June about a surge in coronavirus infections and how a second wave could disrupt the economic recovery**, trigger a spike in unemployment, and prolong the recession.

* **The Treasury Department lent $700 million in coronavirus stimulus funds to a trucking company that warned in May it was in danger of going out of business**. The Treasury – aka U.S. taxpayers – will take a 29.6% equity stake in the company, YRC Worldwide, whose stock had fell 27% this year and was worth $70 million. In 2018, the Justice Department sued YRC for allegedly overcharging the Pentagon millions of dollars for shipping.

4/ **The U.S. bought nearly the entire global stock of one of the drugs proven to work against COVID-19**, leaving the rest of the world unable to purchase it for at least the next three months. Remdesivir, which has been shown to help people recover faster from COVID-19, is the first drug to be approved by the FDA to treat the disease. The Trump administration bought more than 500,000 doses of remdesivir, which is Gilead's entire stock for July and 90% of the supply for August and September.

5/ **Trump called reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban fighters who kill American and coalition forces a "HOAX!"** designed to "damage me and the Republican Party." In a subsequent tweet, Trump repeated his claim that he was never briefed by intelligence officials about the bounty program "because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level." White House officials, however, were first informed in early 2019 of intelligence reports that Russia was offering bounties to kill U.S. and coalition military personnel. Officials also provided Trump with a written briefing of the finding in late February. Trump has also repeatedly dismissed the credibility of the intelligence and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has [acknowledged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/01/only-people-who-are-dismissing-russia-bounties-intel-taliban-russia-trump/) the existence of the intelligence, but said there was “no consensus” and that it hadn’t been completely “verified.” In an additional tweet, Trump claimed that “this is all a made up Fake News Media Hoax started to slander me & the Republican Party.” ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/505379-trump-dismisses-russian-bounty-allegations-as-a-hoax) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885909588/trump-calls-bounty-report-a-hoax-despite-administration-s-briefing-of-congress) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-decries-russian-bounty-reports-as-fake-news-as-his-national-security-adviser-says-response-options-were-prepared/2020/07/01/91b26732-bb93-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html))

* **Taliban commanders confirmed that Russia offered financial and material support in exchange for attacking U.S. forces in Afghanistan**.

7/ **Trump called New York City’s decision to paint "Black Lives Matter" on Fifth Avenue a "symbol of hate"** that would “denigrate” the "luxury" street outside Trump Tower "further antagonize" police.

De Blasio responded to Trump’s tweets, calling them “the definition of racism.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/01/885944289/trump-painting-black-lives-matter-on-5th-avenue-would-be-symbol-of-hate) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/01/trump-black-lives-matter-347051) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-black-lives-matter-hate-af77f4a9-b666-40d2-b4e4-ef23c61088ca.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-painting-black-lives-matter-on-new-yorks-fifth-avenue-would-be-a-symbol-of-hate/2020/07/01/6a039f12-bba2-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html))

8/ **Trump threatened to veto a must-pass defense spending bill if it includes an amendment requiring the Pentagon to rename military bases named after prominent Confederate figures.** The amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act would change the name of 10 U.S. military bases and require the removal of Confederate likenesses, symbols, and paraphernalia from defense facilities across the country within three years. While most Republican senators said they had no problem with Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s amendment, Trump tweeted the bill "if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) \[...\] is in the Bill!"

9/ **A federal judge overturned the Trump administration's 2019 policy that prohibited immigrants from claiming asylum in the U.S. if they didn't attempt to first apply for asylum in a country they passed through on the way to the U.S. border.** U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that the so-called "third-country asylum rule" violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, that the administration “unlawfully promulgated” the rule, failed to show it was in the public interest and didn't abide by the Administrative Procedure Act when adopting the policy. The INA allows anyone who has made it to U.S. soil to apply for asylum, with some exceptions, and the APA requires that Americans be given enough time and opportunity to weigh in on certain rule changes. It's the second time a lower court has concluded the rule is unlawful. Judge Kelly was appointed to the federal bench by Trump in 2017.

10/ **Trump’s reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect today**.
