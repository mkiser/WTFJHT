1/ **The United States set a single-day coronavirus case record for the fifth time in eight days** after reporting more than 50,000 new cases on Wednesday – the largest single-day total since the start of the pandemic. “We are not flattening the curve right now,” said Adm. Brett Giroir, the government’s coronavirus testing coordinator. “The curve is still going up.” Dr. Anthony Fauci added: “I think it’s pretty obvious that we are not going in the right direction." At least 23 states have paused reopening plans ahead of the holiday weekend.

2/ **Texas issued a statewide mandate requiring face masks in public in any county with 20 or more positive COVID-19 cases**. Gov. Greg Abbott previously opposed attempts by mayors and local officials requiring people wear face masks while in public, but reversed course after the state reported a record of more ​​​​than 8,000 new cases on Wednesday. Florida, meanwhile, reported 10,109 new cases on Thursday, marking a new single-day record for the state and the 25th consecutive day that Florida has set a record high in its seven-day rolling average. And in California, where hospitalizations are up more than 40% from two weeks ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the mandatory closure of bars, indoor restaurants, movie theaters, zoos, and museums in 19 counties where 70% of the state’s population lives.

* **The Congressional Budget Office's 10-year forecast expects the U.S. unemployment rate to stay above its pre-pandemic levels through the end of 2030**.

This recession could also nearly quadruple the federal budget deficit this year, pushing it to $3.7 trillion.

4/ **A New York appellate court judge ruled that Simon & Schuster can publish Mary Trump's tell-all book about her uncle, Donald Trump.** The decision from Judge Alan Scheinkman reverses a lower court decision that temporarily halted publication of the book, "[Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man](https://amzn.to/3dRzClP)," which is scheduled for release at the end of July. In his decision, Judge Scheinkman declined to address the central claim from the Trump administration: that Mary Trump violated a 20-year-old non-disclosure agreement by writing the book. Instead, the judge ruled that Simon & Schuster was not a party to the agreement and therefore could not be bound by it.

5/ **The Commerce Department is blocking the release of an investigation's findings into whether it pressured the head of the NOAA into supporting Trump's false claim in 2019 that Hurricane Dorian was going to hit Alabama**, according to the department's inspector general. Peggy E. Gustafson sent a memo to Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross claiming that staff in his department had "thwarted" the publication of her report. Gustafson says the department claims portions of her report contain information that cannot be made public, but refuses to indicate which sections. She says the department's refusal to allow the release of the report "appears to be directly linked to the content of our report and the findings of responsibility of the high-level individuals involved."

* **📌 [Day 1244](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/16/day-1244/): NOAA’s acting administrator "engaged in the misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard" for the agency’s scientific integrity policy** when he released a statement that backed Trump’s false statement about the path of Hurricane Dorian in 2019.

No punishments have been proposed, despite the violations.

The emails also show that the No. 2 official at the agency claimed that neither he nor the acting administrator approved the unsigned statement that a NOAA spokesperson issued on Sept. 6, which criticized the Birmingham National Weather Service forecast office for a tweet that contradicted Trump’s inaccurate assertion that Alabama "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated" from the Category 5 storm.
