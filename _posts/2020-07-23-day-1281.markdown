1/ **The U.S. surpassed four million coronavirus cases a little over two weeks after reaching three million**, doubling the total number of infections in six weeks. New cases climbed by more than 71,000 and the nation’s overall death toll topped 140,000 with more than 1,100 coronavirus deaths reported Wednesday – the first time since May 29 that the daily count exceeded that number. Public health experts have warned that the actual number of infections are potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported and could be as much [13 times higher](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html) in some regions.

* **Two White House cafeterias were closed and contact tracing has been initiated after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.** The cafeterias are in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the New Executive Office Building, which are part of the White House complex located next to the West Wing. It is not clear if the employee who tested positive was a cafeteria worker. The White House did not say what kind of symptoms the employee showed. White House employees were notified in an email and were told there was no need for them to self-quarantine, but they were advised to monitor themselves for symptoms of the virus and to stay home if they felt sick.

2/ **Another 1.4 million U.S. workers filed for unemployment insurance last week**. It was the 18th straight week in which initial claims totaled more than 1 million, snapping a 15-week streak of declining initial claims. 16.2 million people filed for ongoing benefits.

3/ **The White House and Senate Republicans failed to reach an agreement on a coronavirus legislative package**. The main area of dispute was over an extension of the $600 per week federal unemployment assistance for workers that have lost their jobs. The GOP proposal would also replace the expiring $600 benefit with roughly $200 per week. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration would seek to limit the new unemployment payments to 70% of a worker’s wages, saying "You don’t get paid to stay more to stay home than you do when you have a job.” Democrats, meanwhile, want to extend the $600 payment through January. The GOP package would also include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to about 160 million American households. The current draft proposal also does not include a payroll tax cut, Trump’s preferred idea, but does includes $16 billion in funds for new testing, which the administration has opposed, and conditions a portion of education funding on schools reopening.

4/ **Trump insisted that the cognitive test he recently took was “difficult" and "not that easy" because he had to correctly recall the phrase “person, woman, man, camera, TV.”** Trump said he was given "extra points" for repeating the words in order and that his doctors were impressed, because – he claimed – "nobody gets it in order \[...\] But for me it was easy." Trump also claimed that he was able to pass the test "because I have, like, a good memory, because I'm cognitively there." It was the third time Trump had bragged about "acing" a cognitive test in recent interviews. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment consists of one page of basic questions and is used as "a cognitive screening test designed to assist Health Professionals in the detection of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease." \[*Editor's note: I don't like to dunk on mental illness and I try to avoid playing armchair psychologist. But the situation becomes fair game when the president takes victory lap after victory lap about passing a test he should pass in order to question someone else's mental fitness and play politics. WTF, right?*\] ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/23/trump-again-boasts-performance-difficult-cognitive-test/5492305002/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/23/person-woman-man-camera-tv-trump-insists-cognition-test-was-difficult) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cognitive-test-difficulty-claim/))

* **The mayor of Portland was tear gassed by federal agents outside of a federal courthouse during a protest against the presence of federal agents in the city.** Mayor Ted Wheeler was standing at the front of a crowd of demonstrators outside of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse when police fired tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd. It is unclear whether the federal agents knew Wheeler was in the crowd when they used the tear gas. "I’m not going to lie — it stings; it’s hard to breathe," Wheeler said. "And I can tell you with 100 percent honesty, I saw nothing which provoked this response."

5/ **The Senate passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes the removal of Confederate names from military bases**. Trump has threatened to veto the $740 billion bill over the provision to rename Confederate military bases. The House and Senate have now both passed versions of the bill and will spend several weeks negotiating a compromise, which then must pass both chambers before it can be sent for Trump’s signature or veto.
