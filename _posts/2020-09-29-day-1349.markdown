1/ **More than 1 million people have died from the coronavirus worldwide in less than nine months** ‚Äî a figure that is almost certainly an undercount. With more than 200,000 deaths, the U.S. leads the global death toll, followed by Brazil at 142,000, and India at 95,500. The director general of the World Health Organization said the 1 million COVID-19 deaths marked a ‚Äúdifficult moment for the world,‚Äù urging countries to ‚Äúbridge national boundaries‚Äù to fight back against the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, meanwhile, said that Florida‚Äôs move to reopen all bars and restaurants was ‚Äúvery concerning.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/28/health/coronavirus-million-global-deaths-intl/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-has-now-killed-1-million-people-around-world-n1241208) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/29/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/sep/29/coronavirus-live-news-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-be-rolled-out-worldwide-as-global-deaths-near-one-million?page=with:block-5f7308848f0833e1e50424ed#block-5f7308848f0833e1e50424ed) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/29/world/covid-19-coronavirus/nycs-mayor-calls-an-uptick-in-the-citys-daily-positivity-rate-cause-for-real-concern-as-more-schools-reopen) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/coronavirus-global-death-toll-1-million))

2/ **Top White House officials pressured the CDC this summer to play down the risk of the coronavirus to children as the Trump administration pushed to reopen schools this fall**. One member of Pence‚Äôs staff said she was repeatedly asked by Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, to get the CDC to produce reports and charts showing a decline in coronavirus cases among young people that would better support Trump's claims that COVID-19 poses little danger to children and that schools should reopen. As part of the effort to circumvent the CDC, White House officials also tried to find alternate data showing that the pandemic was weakening and posed little danger to children. Olivia Troye, one of Pence‚Äôs top aides on the task force, said she regretted being ‚Äúcomplicit‚Äù in the effort and called the situation a "nightmare." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/us/politics/white-house-cdc-coronavirus-schools.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/health/cdc-pushed-change-data/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/518692-trump-administration-attempted-to-play-down-the-risks-of-returning))

3/ **The Trump administration's distribution of new coronavirus rapid tests have been plagued by confusion and a lack of planning**. Health officials in several states haven't been included in the distribution of the tests, leading to confusion about which nursing homes will receive them until the night before a shipment arrives. The lack of federal planning also has left states with no standardized way to capture results from the fast, cheap, and easy to use tests and include them in daily counts. As a result, as the rapid tests become more widely distributed, the data being used to guide the nation‚Äôs coronavirus response is becoming more inaccurate. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/29/coronavirus-antigen-tests/))

4/ **House Democrats released a new $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief proposal** that includes funding for schools, small businesses, restaurants, airline workers, and more. The bill is $200 billion smaller than the Democrats' most recent proposal, and down from the $3.4 trillion measure passed by the House in May. It also earmarks $75 billion in funding for coronavirus testing, contact tracing, and isolation measures "with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color." It includes a second round of $1,200 payments per taxpayer and $500 per dependent, while extending weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021. It also comes with $436 billion to help state, local, territorial, and tribal governments pay first responders and health workers.

5/ **Biden and Harris released their 2019 tax returns**. Biden‚Äôs return shows that he and his wife paid $299,346 in federal income taxes on a taxable income of $944,737 last year. Harris and her husband reported $3.1 million in taxable income and paid more than $1 million in federal taxes. Trump, a billionaire, [paid $750](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/09/28/day-1348/#1-trump-paid-750-in-federal-income-t) in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017.

* üëë **Portrait of a President: How ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù rescued Trump**. Over 16 years, Trump earned $197 million from the ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù plus an additional $230 million from the licensing and multilevel marketing deals, which helped cover the losses of the real estate and casino projects that made up his business ‚Äúempire.‚Äù "$8,768,330 paid to him by ACN, a multilevel marketing company that was accused of taking advantage of vulnerable investors; $50,000 from the Lifetime channel for a ‚Äújuicy nighttime soap‚Äù that never materialized; $5,026 in net income from a short-lived mortgage business; and $15,286,244 from licensing his name to a line of mattresses. \[...

1. **Michael Flynn's defense lawyer met with Trump and asked that he not issue a pardon**. Sidney Powell, Flynn‚Äôs lawyer, told Judge Emmet Sullivan that ‚ÄúI never discussed this case with the president until recently when I asked him not to issue a pardon and gave him a general update of the status of the litigation." Trump previously said that he would consider a pardon for Flynn, which would end the criminal case.

2. **Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will end the 2020 Census on Oct. 5, despite a federal judge's ruling that allows the count to continue until Oct. 31.** U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh said she was "disturbed" that "despite the court‚Äôs order," Census supervisors have told field workers to wrap up data collection early. Judge Koh set a Tuesday deadline for the Commerce Department to produce the administrative record of the decision-making behind Ross' announcement. She also threatened to hold government lawyers in contempt of court if the deadline isn't met.

3. **Trump allegedly called evangelical pastors ‚Äúhustlers‚Äù in a 2015 conversation with Michael Cohen** after reading an article about an Atlanta-based megachurch pastor trying to raise $60 million to buy a private jet. Trump reportedly told Cohen that the pastor was ‚Äúfull of shit," but was delighted by the ‚Äúscam.‚Äù  ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-secretly-mocks-his-christian-supporters/616522/))

4. **John Ratcliffe declassifies information related to the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation:**

In late July 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies obtained insight into Russian intelligence analysis alleging that U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had approved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against U.S Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians' hacking of the Democratic National Committee. The IC does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.

According to his handwritten notes, former Central Intelligence Agency Director Brennan subsequently briefed President Obama and other senior national security officials on the intelligence, including the "alleged approval by Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016 of a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services."

On 07 September 2016, U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an investigative referral to FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok regarding "U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail server."
