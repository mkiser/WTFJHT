1/ **Trump told associates he intends to declare premature victory on Election Night in order to cast doubt on the integrity of the election and undermine the validity of uncounted mail-in ballots in the days after**. Many states, however, won't be done counting mail ballots by Tuesday night and it's common for some states to take several days to finalize vote counts. Trump, nevertheless, told confidants he'll declare victory on election night if it looks like he's "ahead." Speaking to reporters later, Trump first denied that he would declare victory prematurely, before confirming that he would try to shut down tabulating votes after polls close. "I think it's a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election \[...\] when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over \[...\] that we can't know the results of an election the night of the election. As soon as that election's over, we're going in with our lawyers."

2/ **Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the U.S. should prepare "for a whole lot of hurt" this winter from the coronavirus pandemic**, saying "it's not a good situation" and "you could not possibly be positioned more poorly." Fauci said the country needs to make an "abrupt change" in its public health practices, because “all the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors.” Fauci also praised the Biden campaign’s approach to the coronavirus, saying it was “taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is "looking at it from a different perspective," which he said was "the economy and reopening the country." The White House, meanwhile, said it was "unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci \[...\] to choose three days before an election to play politics." Trump, however, has continued to tour the country insisting that the U.S. has “turned the corner” on the coronavirus even as the nation set a new daily record Friday with more than 98,000 cases.

3/ **Trump threatened to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Election Day**. While Trump was complaining about news media coverage of COVID-19 a campaign rally in South Florida, the crowd broke out into a "Fire Fauci" chant. “Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election,” Trump said, adding he appreciated their “advice.” At a campaign stop in Cleveland, Ohio, Biden weighed in: "I got a better idea. Elect me, and I'm gonna hire Dr. Fauci. And we're gonna fire Donald Trump."

* **Trump baselessly claimed that doctors are lying about the number of Americans who’ve died from COVID-19 for monetary gain**. There is no evidence for Trump's claim. "Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid. You know that, right? I mean our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say 'I'm sorry but everybody dies of Covid,'" Trump said, without citing any evidence, at a rally in Michigan.

4/ **Trump approved of his supporters surrounding a Biden campaign bus and attempting to run it off the highway in Texas**, tweeting a video of the caravan boxing in the campaign bus with the caption, "I LOVE TEXAS!" The FBI said it was investigating the incident. Trump defended the Texas drivers, tweeting “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!” Trump revisited the story hours later, falsely claiming that an FBI investigation was "FALSE" and tweeting that his supporters "did nothing wrong." Trump again said the FBI should be investigating "ANTIFA" instead. The Biden campaign canceled at least one event in Texas following the episode. Meanwhile in New York and New Jersey, a caravan of Trump supporters halted traffic on two major highways.
