1/ **Trump called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and urged him to call a special session of the state legislature so lawmakers could appoint electors who would back him at the electoral college and overturn Biden's win in the state**. Trump also asked Kemp to order an audit of absentee ballot signatures. "I will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor @BrianKempGA or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification. Has not been done and will show large scale discrepancies,” Trump tweeted. “Why are these two ‘Republicans’ saying no? If we win Georgia, everything else falls in place!” Kemp, however, told Trump that he did not have the authority to order an audit and denied the request to call a special session. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, meanwhile, said a special session to overturn the state’s election results “would be then nullifying the will of the people.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-kemp-call-georgia/2020/12/05/fd8d677c-3721-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/05/brian-kemp-trump-georgia-election-443068) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/05/politics/trump-georgia-brian-kemp-phone-call/index.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/georgia-kemp-trump-election-attacks-4f2dfaaa-a917-4c0e-943a-7606cb8114df.html) / [Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-kemp-wont-attend-trumps-georgia-rally-on-saturday/4ZGHTTK5YJDIDJ7YVUMTPEIMGY/))

3/ **The Trump administration rejected requests from Biden’s transition team to meet with officials at the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies**. The Pentagon's recently appointed chief of staff, Kash Patel, reportedly "told everybody we're not going to cooperate with the transition team," according one former official, and he has "put a lot of restrictions on it." In some instances, Patel blocked some career officials and experts from providing information about key defense issues to the Biden transition team, telling political appointees to take the lead instead. The Pentagon, meanwhile, pushed back against reports that the Trump administration had intentionally blocked the Biden transition team from meeting with defense intelligence agencies, saying the Biden team had improperly reached out to the agencies instead of the DoD transition team. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/pentagon-blocks-biden-transition-team/2020/12/04/2e7042fa-3656-11eb-a997-1f4c53d2a747_story.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-loyalist-kash-patel-blocking-some-pentagon-officials-helping-biden-n1250053) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/05/pentagon-denies-blocking-biden-transition-443080))

Giuliani, who has frequently appeared maskless, traveled to Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia last week and met indoors with state legislators to advance Trump's baseless claims of election fraud. The Arizona Legislature, meanwhile, will close for a week "out of an abundance of caution" after Giuliani possibly exposed several Republican lawmakers to COVID-19. And public health officials in Michigan [ordered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/07/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/#link-7WWOGQ27YVADFI43K6CL5IOYFI) several state lawmakers to begin quarantining  after they were in recent, close contact with Giuliani.

6/ **Attorney General William Barr is considering resigning before January 20**.
