1/ **The FDA confirmed that Moderna's two-dose COVID-19 vaccine was “highly effective” and safe for adults**, setting it up for an emergency authorization later this week to become the country's second authorized COVID-19 shot. The FDA said the vaccine is 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 cases at least 14 days after vaccination and that there were no significant safety concerns. An FDA document also shows that asymptomatic infection was reduced by 63% after the first shot. Between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the U.S. has acquired 300 million doses in the first quarter of 2021 – enough doses for 150 million people.
