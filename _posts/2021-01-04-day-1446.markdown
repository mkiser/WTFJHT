1/ **Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to “find” him enough votes to overturn the state's presidential election results**. Trump told Brad Raffensperger in an hourlong phone call, which also included Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and legal advisers, “We have won the election in Georgia based on all of this. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, Brad.” Raffensperger pushed back, telling Trump “the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.” Trump, however, continued to push his debunked theories of election fraud, like "stuffed ballot boxes," and, at one point said: “So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.” Trump later added: “So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.” At one point, Trump warned that Raffensperger was taking “a big risk” by not pursuing his false claims and threatened him with "a criminal offense." Throughout the call, Trump repeated that “There’s no way I lost Georgia \[...\] There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.” Trump lost to Biden by 11,779 votes. Since the election, there have been [18 attempted calls](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/politics/trump-brad-raffensperger-calls-georgia/index.html) from the White House to the Georgia secretary of state's office. An intern monitoring the line, [however](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-04/trump-splinters-gop-with-doomed-bid-for-congress-to-subvert-vote?sref=MIBMEEoj), thought the calls were a prank and hung up.

* **All 10 living former Defense secretaries said the "time for questioning the results" of the 2020 election has passed** and warned that involving the U.S. military in election disputes would take the country into "dangerous" territory.

2/ **Trump's call to Georgia's secretary of state may have violated laws that prohibit interference in federal or state elections**. Brad Raffensperger said that while it was unlikely his office would open an investigation into the call with Trump, he suggested that a criminal probe could still be launched by an Atlanta-area district attorney. Raffensperger added, “I understand that the Fulton County district attorney wants to look at it. Maybe that’s the appropriate venue for it to go.” A pair of House Democrats, meanwhile, asked FBI Director Christopher Wray to open a criminal probe, believing that Trump "engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes."

3/ **A top election official in Georgia accused Trump’s legal team of "intentionally misleading" voters about voter fraud**. In a press conference, Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia voting system implementation manager, systematically refuted Trump’s already-debunked claims of voter fraud, saying "This is all easily, provably false. Yet the president persists, and by doing so undermines Georgians’ faith in the election system.” Sterling added: “It was intentional, it was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that."

4/ **A group of at least 11 Republican senators and senators-elect plan to challenge Biden’s Electoral College win on Jan. 6**, calling for an “emergency 10-day audit” to investigate Trump’s numerous unfounded election fraud claims. The senators – led by Ted Cruz – provided no evidence, but cited unsubstantiated allegations of fraud and said they intend "to reject the electors from disputed states as not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified.'" The same claims have been repeatedly rejected by courts. The new Congress will meet Wednesday to formally count the Electoral College votes. Pence, as the president of the senate, will preside over the joint session and signaled support for the effort to vote against certification.

5/ **Covid-19 cases in the United States eclipsed 20 million as Trump falsely tweeted that the coronavirus cases and deaths are "exaggerated."** Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed back on the claim, saying "The numbers are real. We have well over 300,000 deaths. We are averaging two to three thousand deaths per day." U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams also contradicted Trump's claim, saying there is "no reason to doubt" the CDC's Covid-19 death toll. The nation reported more than 210,000 new cases for Sunday as hospitalizations hit a record-high 125,544.
