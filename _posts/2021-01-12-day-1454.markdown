1/ **Trump refused to take responsibility for inciting the deadly riot at the Capitol, offered no regrets, and defended his pre-riot speech as "totally appropriate."** In his first public remarks since the violence last week that left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer, Trump deflected blame and called the effort by House Democrats to impeach him for a second time a “witch hunt” that was "causing tremendous anger." The attack on the Capitol came after Trump encouraged a crowd of supporters to march to the building and "fight like hell," saying: "You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong." Trump also took aim at social media sites that have banned him, saying they had made a “catastrophic mistake” and acted in a “divisive” manner. Trump then left Washington to travel to Alamo, Tex., to tour a section of his border wall.

2/ **Mitch McConnell indicated that he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses** and that he is reportedly "pleased" that Democrats are moving to impeach him. McConnell, who blames Trump for Republicans losing the Senate, believes impeaching Trump a second time would make it easier to "purge" him from the party. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, has asked other Republicans whether he should call on Trump to resign. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said she will vote to impeach Trump, saying there has “never been a greater betrayal” by a president to his office and his oath to the Constitution.

3/ **Two days before the riot at the Capitol, the FBI warned that extremists were traveling to Washington to commit violence and “war.”** The internal FBI report, produced Jan. 5 by the F.B.I.’s Norfolk office in southern Virginia and sent to the bureau’s Washington Field Office, included examples of people sharing a map of the Capitol's tunnels and possible meet-up points in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and South Carolina before traveling to Washington. The report also said “An online thread discussed specific calls for violence to include stating ‘Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capitol-riot-fbi-intelligence/2021/01/12/30d12748-546b-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/fbi-report-capitol.html))

5/ **Trump declared a state of emergency in Washington, D.C., citing the “emergency conditions” surrounding Biden’s inauguration**. Trump’s order allows the Department of Homeland Security and the FEMA to assist the city in any emergency response. There will be at least 10,000 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., by Saturday – that's more troops than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.

Brad Schneider, Pramila Jayapal, and Bonnie Watson Coleman all tested positive for Covid-19 since Monday. Schneider said "several Republican lawmakers in the room adamantly refused to wear a mask \[...\] even when politely asked by their colleagues." Jayapal added that "several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one."

7/ **The Trump administration expanded coronavirus vaccine eligibility to all Americans over 65 to accelerate distribution**.
