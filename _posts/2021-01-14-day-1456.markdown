1/ **Biden released a $1.9 trillion economic and health care rescue package** to deliver direct aid to families, businesses, and communities, and provide money for testing and vaccine distribution. The emergency relief plan includes $400 billion for fighting the coronavirus, more than $1 trillion in direct relief to families, including direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, and $440 billion for aid to communities and businesses. Called the ‚ÄúAmerican Rescue Plan,‚Äù the proposal would meet Biden‚Äôs goal of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration, and help advance his plans to reopen most schools by the spring.

2/ **Biden urged the Senate to balance the impeachment trial of Trump with the "other urgent business of this nation."** The Senate won‚Äôt return until Jan. 19 ‚Äì the day before Biden‚Äôs inauguration ‚Äì which means Trump's trial will create a logistical challenge, and risks delaying confirmation of Biden‚Äôs cabinet nominees and legislative initiatives. All 100 senators must consent to allow the chamber to confirm Biden‚Äôs Cabinet and pass his legislative agenda on one track, and begin Trump‚Äôs trial for ‚Äúincitement of insurrection‚Äù on another. Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, hasn‚Äôt detailed her schedule for transmitting the single article of impeachment to the Senate.

3/ **Trump is reportedly in "self-pity mode" after becoming the only U.S. president to be impeached twice**. According to White House advisers and people close to him, Trump and has become "increasingly isolated, sullen, and vengeful" after being left to fend for himself at the White House as impeachment quickly gained steam. Trump has also instructed aides not to pay Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs legal fees, demanding that he personally approve any reimbursements for the expenses Giuliani incurred while traveling on his behalf to challenge election results. Trump has apparently expressed concern with some of Giuliani‚Äôs decisions. The lawyers who defended Trump in his previous impeachment trial, including Jay Sekulow and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, have declined to defend him during the second impeachment trial.

4/ **Trump issued an appeal for nonviolence after the House voted to impeach him for "incitement of insurrection,"** saying he ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump released the five-minute video following heavy pressure from his advisers. He offered no humility, regret, or self-reflection, failed to mention the election, and did not concede that Biden won a free and fair election. The video was released through the White House Twitter account, because his personal account was permanently suspended on fears it could incite further violence. Trump alluded to the ban, saying there had been an ‚Äúunprecedented assault on free speech.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-video-capitol-riot.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/13/trump-impeachment-biden-transition-live-updates/#link-QM7FNFBHFZAQJLK6GFMREIIS3E) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/13/trump-denounces-capitol-attack-459074) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/trump-condemns-capitol-violence-a-week-after-riot-as-he-faces-second-impeachment-trial.html))

5/ **Democratic lawmakers accused Republican colleagues of leading groups on ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù tours of the Capitol the day before Trump supporters stormed the building**. Rep. Mikie Sherrill said she saw ‚Äúmembers of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on Jan. 5 for reconnaissance for the next day.‚Äù At least one protest organizer said he coordinated with three House Republicans and Capitol Police officers said they wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some lawmakers helped organize the attack. Meanwhile, at least 31 members of Congress demanded that the acting House Sergeant of Arms, acting Senate Sergeant of Arms, and Acting Chief of the Capitol Police investigate what they described as an ‚Äúextremely high number of outside groups‚Äù let into the building on Jan. 5 at a time when most tours were restricted because of the coronavirus pandemic. The letter says the tours were "unusual" and "concerning" and were reported to the Sergeant at Arms on Jan. 5, adding that the groups "could only have gained access to the Capitol Complex from a Member of Congress or a member of their staff." Dozens of people on [the FBI‚Äôs terrorist watch list](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/terror-watchlist-capitol-riot-fbi/2021/01/14/07412814-55f7-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html) were in Washington D.C. on the day of the Capitol insurrection ‚Äì¬†the majority suspected white supremacists whose past conduct was so alarming that their names had been previously added to the national Terrorist Screening Database.
