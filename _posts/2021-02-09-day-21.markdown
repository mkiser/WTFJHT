### ‚öñÔ∏è Trump‚Äôs Second Senate Impeachment Trial:

**What happened today?**

1. **Trump's impeachment trial kicked off in the Senate with House Democrats playing a video montage of Trump whipping up a crowd of supporters**, encouraging them to march to the U.S. Capitol and ‚Äúfight like hell,‚Äù showing the pro-Trump mob violently breaching the Capitol, attacking police officers, and invoking Trump's name as they tried to disrupt the certification of the November election. ‚ÄúSenators, this cannot be our future. This cannot be the future of America," Rep. Jamie Raskin said in opening remarks. "We cannot have presidents inciting and mobilizing mob violence against our government and our institutions because they refuse to accept the will of the people.‚Äù

2. **The first day of the proceeding were devoted to a debate over the constitutionality of the House prosecuting a president who has already left office**. While Trump‚Äôs lawyers condemned the violence, they rejected the suggestion that he was responsible for it and maintained that the Constitution did not allow for an impeachment trial of a former president because it was meant to lead to removal. According to his [defense attorneys](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-actions-capitol-attacks/2021/02/09/6dada250-6a3b-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html), Trump was ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù by the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and that it is ‚Äúabsolutely not true‚Äù that Trump failed to quickly act to end the riot. In their revisionist history, Trump reportedly tweeted calls for peace ‚Äúupon hearing of the reports of violence‚Äù and took ‚Äúimmediate steps‚Äù to mobilize resources to counter the rioters storming the building ‚Äì these statements, however, conflict with the actual timeline of events. Bruce Castor, one of Trump's attorneys, argued that Trump should not be punished for a ‚Äúpolitical speech,‚Äù and since he is "no longer is in office ... the object of the Constitution has been achieved. He was removed by the voters.‚Äù House impeachment managers, meanwhile, argued that there is no ‚ÄúJanuary exception‚Äù for presidents to escape repercussions through impeachment on their way out of office, saying the framers of the Constitution did not provide a waiver for accountability.

3. **After House managers and Trump's team presented their arguments on whether the trial was constitutional, the Senate voted 56 to 44 to proceed with Trump's impeachment trial**. Six Republicans voted to affirm the constitutionality of the trial.
