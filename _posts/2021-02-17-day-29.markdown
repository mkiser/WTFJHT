1/ **Biden suggested that anyone in the country who wants a vaccine should be able to get one "by the end of July."** Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said in a task force briefing that "We are on track to have enough vaccine supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July." The U.S. has averaged 1.64 million doses a day over the last week and about 56.3 million total doses have been administered. If the pace of vaccination stays where it is now, Biden’s initial goal of 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots in the first 100 days of his presidency would be met in late March – around Day 67 of his presidency.

2/ **Biden clarified that his goal is to open the majority of K-8 schools by the end of his first 100 days in office**. When asked to clarify what he meant by "open," Biden said "I think many of them five days a week. The goal will be five days a week" in person. [Last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/02/10/day-22/#4-the-white-house-clarified-biden%E2%80%99s), White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration wants more than 50% of schools to have “some teaching” in person “at least one day a week” – not fully reopened – by the end of April. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, stressed that teachers should be given priority for Covid-19 vaccinations, but wouldn’t say if she believed that teacher vaccinations should be a prerequisite for reopening schools. Dr. Anthony Fauci, however, added that vaccinating all teachers against Covid-19 before reopening schools is a "non-workable" solution.

3/ **The Biden administration will invest more than $1.6 billion to expand coronavirus testing and genetic sequencing**. About $650 million will go toward testing in K-8 schools and homeless shelters, $815 million will increase manufacturing to address shortages in testing supplies, and $200 million will go to increasing genetic sequencing efforts to help track existing and new variants. The White House called the $200 million a “down payment” that would increase the number of virus samples that labs can sequence jumping from around 7,000 to around 25,000 each week. Testing coordinator Carole Johnson, meanwhile, described the $1.6 billion a “pilot” that will serve as a bridge until Congress passes the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.

4/ **Biden declined to support Democratic proposals to cancel up to $50,000 per borrower in student loan debt**, saying "I will not make that happen." Biden, however, said he was prepared to cancel $10,000 in debt, but anything more than that would require congressional action. Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, and other lawmakers introduced a resolution in early February calling on Biden to use executive action to wipe out up to $50,000 in student loan debt, arguing that the secretary of education has broad administrative authority to cancel the federal debt. In response to Biden’s dismissal to forgiving student debt, Schumer and Warren issued a joint statement saying that action is needed “to immediately deliver much-needed relief to millions of Americans.” “It’s time to act. We will keep fighting,” they added.

5/ **Economists warn that millions of jobs that have been eliminated by the coronavirus pandemic are permanent and unlikely to come back**. A report coming out later this week from the McKinsey Global Institute says that 20% of business travel won’t come back and about 20% of workers could end up working from home indefinitely, which means fewer jobs at hotels, restaurants, and downtown shops. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2021/02/17/unemployed-workers-retraining/))
