1/ **House Democrats plan to pass the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill by Friday**, setting up the Senate to approve the bill with a simple majority, and send it to Biden before March 14, when several unemployment programs expire. A ruling from the Senate parliamentarian is expected soon about whether Biden’s proposed $15-an-hour minimum wage increase would be allowable under Senate "budget reconciliation" rules.  Meanwhile, more than 150 American companies urged congressional leaders to pass "immediate and large-scale federal legislation to address the health and economic crises brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic," saying “more must be done to put the country on a trajectory for a strong, durable recovery.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/house-democrats-aim-to-pass-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-on-friday.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/02/24/biden-stimulus-covid-relief-minimum-wage/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/24/politics/business-leaders-biden-covid-plan/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/more-than-150-executives-back-biden-1-9-trillion-stimulus-plan?sref=MIBMEEoj))
