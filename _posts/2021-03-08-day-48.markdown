1/ **The Senate passed the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package**. The American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks for hundreds of millions of Americans, $300-per-week jobless benefits until early September, a child allowance of up to $3,600 for one year, $350 billion for state aid, $34 billion to expand Affordable Care Act subsidies, and $14 billion for vaccine distribution. “I promised the American people help was on the way,” Biden said. “Today, I can say we’ve taken one more giant step of delivering on that promise.” The final vote was 50-49 along party lines. The legislation will have to be passed by the House again before Biden can sign it into law, because the Senate made changes to its version. The Senate bill limited the number of people receiving direct payments, capping them at $80,000 in income for individuals and $160,000 for couples. It also reduced the jobless benefit to $300 from $400 in the House bill. The House plans to pass the relief bill as soon as Tuesday, putting Biden on track to sign his first major legislative accomplishment into law by the end of the week. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, [meanwhile](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/white-house-covid-relief-checks-could-reach-millions-end-month-n1260033), said that the Treasury Department was still “working on” the exact timeline of the stimulus check rollout, but that the White House expected “a large number of Americans to receive relief by the end of the month.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-including-1-n1259795) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/biden-stimulus-plan.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/06/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-19-trillion-coronavirus-relief-bill/story?id=76295820) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/stimulus-update-house-plans-to-pass-biden-covid-relief-bill-tuesday.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/08/stimulus-house-biden-coronavirus/))

The U.S. administered 5.3 million vaccines over the weekend, and is now administering more than 2 million shots a day on average. New coronavirus cases in the U.S., meanwhile, posted the slowest weekly increase since the pandemic began almost a year ago. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/07/covid-us-vaccinations-hit-record-officials-warn-against-easing-restrictions.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-08/u-s-coronavirus-cases-have-slowest-weekly-gain-of-the-pandemic?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj))

2/ **New CDC guidance says that people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can safely visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing**.  The recommendations also say that vaccinated people can visit  indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe Covid-19 disease. The CDC, however, recommends that vaccinated people continue to adhere to public health restrictions, such as mask wearing and social distancing while in public. Dr. Anthony Fauci also warned that it is too early to end Covid-19 restrictions, saying “we’re going in the right direction but we just need to hang on a bit longer." The guidelines continue to discourage visits involving long-distance travel.

3/ **Russian intelligence agencies are spreading disinformation to undermine confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines**. The State Department’s Global Engagement Center identified four Russian websites spreading misinformation about the virus, as well as "international organizations, military conflicts, protests; and any divisive issue that they can exploit." The campaign has played up the risk of side effects, questioned the efficacy of the vaccines, and said the U.S. rushed the Pfizer vaccine through the approval process, among other false or misleading claims. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/07/politics/russian-disinformation-pfizer-vaccines/index.html))

4/ **The Biden administration notified facilities handling migrant children that they can expand to full, pre-Covid-19 capacity**, acknowledging "extraordinary circumstances" due to a rising number of minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Shelters had been operating at 50% capacity to slow the spread of the coronavirus. A separate CDC document, however, says "facilities should plan for and expect to have Covid-19 cases," citing the nature of the pandemic and that "there is no 0% risk scenario." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/05/politics/immigration-border-crowding-covid/index.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/cdc-child-migrant-shelter-full-capacity-coronavirus-41d1ae80-1ecf-4815-a755-7b01fac5850b.html))

5/ **The Biden administration granted temporary protected status to up to 320,000 Venezuelan migrants in the United States**. The designation offers legal protections for 18 months to Venezuelans unable to safely return home because of natural disaster, violence, or civil unrest. Eligibility extends only to those in the country as of March 8 who apply within the next 180 days and meet vetting requirements.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/churches-black-voters-georgia.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-republicans-are-pushing-dozens-election-integrity-bills-black-voters-n1259687))
