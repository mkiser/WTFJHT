1/ **Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic relief package into law** – his first major legislative achievement in office. “This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country,” Biden said during signing. The American Rescue Package authorizes a third round of one-time stimulus payments up to $1,400 for most Americans, extends enhanced unemployment benefits, and changes the tax code to benefit families with children. The package also unlocks new federal aid to help schools reopen, aid cities and states with budget shortfalls, provide billions in aid for small businesses, and assists in the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. has officially allocated over $5 trillion in funding for Covid-19 relief.

3/ **Biden will address the nation tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern**, marking the one-year anniversary of the day the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, and Covid-19 restrictions that forced the U.S. into lockdown. Biden is expected to use his prime-time remarks to "address the American people and talk about what we went through as a nation this past year." Biden previewed his remarks on Wednesday, saying “I’m going to talk about what comes next \[...\] explain what we will do as a government and what we will ask of the American people. There is light at the end of this dark tunnel. But we cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable. Together, we're gonna get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-1st-primetime-speech-reflect-year-pandemic-shutdowns/story?id=76365143) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/biden-to-map-path-from-dark-tunnel-with-aid-about-to-roll-out?srnd=politics-vp&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/11/politics/joe-biden-one-year-covid-address/index.html))

8/ **Former Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said he believes that Trump's speech on the morning of Jan. 6 caused a mob to violently attack the U.S. Capitol later that day**, saying “Would anybody have marched on the Capitol, and tried to overrun the Capitol, without the president’s speech? I think it’s pretty much definitive that wouldn’t have happened.” As the acting defense secretary at the time, Miller was in charge of the military’s response and has since been criticized for the Department of Defense's slow deployment of the National Guard. While Miller has rejected the criticism, calling the speed of the response normal, he added that political climate at the time as a “constant drumbeat” of “potential illegal, immoral, and unethical activities.” ([Vice News](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx83v4/even-trumps-defense-secretary-during-the-capitol-riot-blames-him-for-inciting-it))
