1/ **Biden directed states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccinations no later than May 1**, and set a July 4th goal to "mark our independence from this virus." The White House has [promised](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/03/02/day-42/#1-biden-said-the-u-s-expects-to-have) that the country will have enough vaccine supply for all adults by the end of May – meaning not all adults will be able to get a vaccine on May 1, but instead they will be able to get in line for one. Biden also said he was doubling the number of pharmacies and the number of federally run mass vaccination centers to administer doses. The U.S., meanwhile, has administered more than 100 million Covid-19 shots so far, with 35 million people have been fully vaccinated and 66 million having received at least a first dose. The U.S. is now averaging of over 2 million doses a day. And at a Rose Garden event celebrating the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, Biden said the legislation "changes the paradigm. For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-use-covid-shutdown-anniversary-speech-preview-post-pandemic-future-n1260706) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/11/975420676/biden-to-address-the-nation-marking-1-year-of-coronavirus-pandemic) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-address-vaccine/2021/03/11/2cde7132-8278-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/11/22326478/biden-speech-covid-19-vaccine-may-adults) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-100-million-shots-americans/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/u-s-hits-100-million-dose-mark-three-months-into-vaccine-push?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/us/biden-stimulus.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/covid-vaccine-biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adults-eligible-by-may-1.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/11/joe-biden-covid-vaccine-us-adults-1-may))

2/ **The Justice Department expects to charge at least 100 more still-unidentified people connected to the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol**. Describing the investigation as "one of the largest," "most complex" investigations and prosecutions in U.S. history, federal prosecutors have charged 320 people so far, executed more than 900 search warrants, and have received more than 15,000 hours of surveillance video. Authorities have also reviewed more 1,600 electronic devices, 210,000 tips, and 80,000 witness interviews. Prosecutors asked a judge for 60-day delays across a series of Capitol riot cases, saying it “will take time” to organize the evidence and make it available to suspects and their defense attorneys.

3/ **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, and at least 13 other House Democrats from New York called for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign**. Six women have accused Cuomo of sexual assault or harassment, and allegations have also [emerged](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/03/05/day-45/#4-new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo%E2%80%99s-senior) that his administration covered up Covid nursing home deaths. "Unfortunately, the Governor is not only facing the accusation that he engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment and assault,"  the lawmakers said in a joint statement. "There is also the extensive report from the Attorney General that found the Cuomo administration hid data on COVID-19 nursing home deaths from both the public and the state legislature." The six harassment allegations are being investigated by state Attorney General Letitia James, while Democrats in the state Assembly initiated an impeachment investigation that will be carried out concurrently with the AG probe. Cuomo, meanwhile, addressed the allegations at a news conference, saying “I did not do what has been alleged, period \[...\] I’m not going to resign, I was not elected by the politicians, I was elected by the people.”  ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/aoc-nadler-ny-leaders-call-cuomo-resignation-wake/story?id=76415698) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/976064389/cuomo-aide-says-governor-groped-her-in-executive-mansion) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/several-house-democrats-including-ocasio-cortez-jerry-nadler-call-cuomo-n1260915) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/12/politics/new-york-congress-cuomo-resignation/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/cuomo-defies-calls-to-resign-refutes-sex-harassment-claims?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/nyregion/cuomo-resign-congress.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/12/cuomo-ny-congress-democrats-resignations-475522) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomo-sexual-harassment-investigations/2021/03/11/a3eb4038-80e9-11eb-ac37-4383f7709abe_story.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/12/andrew-cuomo-resign-new-york-democrats-aoc-nadler))

4/ **The Biden administration will end a Trump-era policy that allowed the Department of Homeland Security to deport caregivers for unaccompanied migrant children**. The 2018 policy allowed DHS to identify the immigration status of would-be caregivers and deport those who were in the country illegally. Officials said they hoped that revoking the policy would encourage more parents to come forward to claim their children, which would also help alleviate crowding at Health and Human Services facilities.

5/ **The Manhattan district attorney leading the criminal investigation against Trump and the Trump Organization will not run for re-election**. The decision by Cyrus Vance means that if he decides to indict Trump, the next district attorney will inherit the investigation and be responsible for prosecuting Trump.
