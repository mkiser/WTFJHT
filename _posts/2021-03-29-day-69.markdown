1/ **CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned of "impending doom" as Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths rise throughout the U.S.** The seven-day average for new daily Covid-19 cases is nearly at 60,000 – up 10% from the prior week. Hospitalizations are up to about 4,800 a day, from 4,600 a week earlier. And, deaths  have also started to rise again. Walensky attributed the rise to the spread of more contagious variants, increased travel, and governors lowering restrictions too quickly. "We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope," Walensky said, "but right now I’m scared.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/cdc-director-warns-impending-doom-covid-cases-rise-n1262355) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/29/cdc-chief-covid-cases-surge-478340) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/cdc-chief-warns-of-impending-doom-as-covid-cases-deaths-rise?sref=MIBMEEoj))

* **A WHO-China report on the origins of Covid-19 concluded that the most likely scenario of the coronavirus jumping from bats to humans was through another animal** and that the lab leak theory is “extremely unlikely.” It is not clear, however, if China will allow outside experts direct access to the data. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “We’ve got real concerns about the methodology and the process that went into that report, including the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/who-report-animals-source-covid-19-coronavirus-8a839c179c330c56fa46a763b7286a7f) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/29/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases/coronavirus-bats-who-china))
