1/ **Biden will keep Trump's historically low refugee admissions target at 15,000**, walking back his pledge to lift the cap to 62,500 this year and push it to 125,000 for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Biden, however, signed an emergency determination to speed refugee admissions to the U.S and adjust the allocation limits set by Trump, who placed strict restrictions on accepting refugees from certain African and majority-Muslim countries. Rep. Ilhan Omar called Biden's decision "shameful," while Rep. Pramila Jayapal said it was "disastrous."

2/ **The Biden administration will spend $1.7 billion to track coronavirus variants**.

* **The U.S. and other nations will likely need booster shots and annual vaccinations against Covid-19**. David Kessler, the chief science officer for Covid-19 response,, told a House subcommittee hearing that the U.S. should plan for booster shots in the future.
