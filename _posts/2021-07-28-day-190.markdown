1/ **The White House and a bipartisan group of senators agreed on Wednesday on a far-reaching $1 trillion infrastructure bill.** Democrats set an evening vote to advance it, paving the way for action on a crucial piece of President Biden’s agenda. According to a fact sheet released Wednesday afternoon by the White House, the resulting bill would provide about $550 billion in new federal money for roads, bridges, rail, transit, water and other physical infrastructure programs.

2/ **Trump tried and failed to sabotage the Biden infrastructure deal**. Those close to the former president say he remains miffed that Senate Republicans didn’t move a bill when he was in office. Though he has increasingly sought to undermine negotiations, Trump’s efforts to derail any infrastructure package have, so far, mostly been met with a shrug on Capitol Hill.

3/ **Four police officers delivered emotional testimony on Tuesday during the first hearing of the House select committee on the 1/6 insurrection.** The officers recounted the physical and verbal abuse they endured defending the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 from a mob of Trump supporters. The officers urged members of the panel to probe the role that Trump played on Jan. 6, with Officer Dunn comparing the former president to someone who hired a “hit man.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/27/jan-6-commission-hearing-live-updates/))

4/ **Biden will announce a vaccination requirement for all federal government employees and contractors on Thursday.** All federal employees and contractors will be required to get vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to regular testing and mitigation requirements.

5/ **The CDC is urging vaccinated people in COVID hot spots to resume wearing masks indoors.** Health officials are also calling for all teachers, staffers and students in schools to wear masks, regardless of their vaccination status. CDC director Rochelle Walensky expressed disappointment and dismay that the summer surge in cases, driven by the delta variant’s startling transmissibility and low vaccination rates in many areas, had forced her agency’s hand.

6/ **Nancy Pelosi said Kevin McCarthy is a "moron" for opposing a mask mandate in the House**. Brian Monahan, the Capitol physician, instituted a new mask mandate for the lower chamber late Tuesday night in response to a spike in infections from the delta variant of the coronavirus. When asked about McCarthy's comments opposing the mandate, Pelosi said, "He's such a moron." ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/565216-pelosi-mccarthy-a-moron-for-opposing-mask-mandate))
