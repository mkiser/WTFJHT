1/ **The Senate passed a $3.5 trillion budget plan that includes a sweeping expansion of the social safety net. **The 92-page blueprint, which would expand Medicaid, provide free preschool and community college, and fund climate change programs, passed along party lines. The blueprint sets in motion a perilous legislative process aimed at creating the largest expansion of the federal safety net in nearly six decades. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/us/politics/senate-budget-plan.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/10/senate-vote-a-rama-503427))

2/ **Cuomo announced his resignation in an effort to head off a likely impeachment after a devastating report found he sexually harassed 11 women. **“Wasting energy on distractions is the last thing that state government should be doing,” the three-term governor of New York said in a video address. “And I cannot be the cause of that.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/andrew-cuomo-resigns/2021/08/10/cfd44154-7ac2-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html))

3/ **The federal government sent ventilators to Florida even as Gov. Ron DeSantis says he's unaware of the shipment**. A health administration official confirms the Strategic National Stockpile sent 200 ventilators and 100 high-flow nasal cannula kits to the state of Florida "earlier this week." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/politics/florida-ventilators-desantis/index.html))

4/ **California is the first state to require teachers and school staff to be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to regular testing in order to return to school.** Gov. Gavin Newsom cited the surging delta variant, which has challenged plans for the opening of school this fall. Data, he said, shows the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.

5/ **The Texas House speaker signed arrest warrants for the state Democrats who broke quorum over impending GOP voting restrictions**. The move followed approval of a House motion to send for absent members, which enabled Phelan to issue the warrants. The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday also stayed a trial court judge’s ruling that would have protected absent Democrats from arrest.

6/ **A federal judge says Trump’s accountants must turn over his tax records to the House of Representatives**. A federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump must disclose certain financial records held by his accounting firm Mazars in response to a subpoena from congressional Democrats. The judge approved a subpoena for Trump’s records covering 2017 and 2018, but turned down most of the panel’s request for similar information dating back to 2011.

7/ **Biden nominated Damian Williams to be the next U.S. Attorney in Manhattan**. The selection is part of a slate of nominations for top law enforcement posts in the country, including for three offices that tend to investigate the Justice Department’s most prominent cases. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/biden-us-attorneys.html))

8/ **YouTube suspended Sen. Rand Paul over a video that falsely claims masks are ineffective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus**. The suspension was “a badge of honor," Paul tweeted.
