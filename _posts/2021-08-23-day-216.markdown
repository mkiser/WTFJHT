1/ **The FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine**, clearing the path to more vaccine mandates at hospitals, colleges, corporations and other organizations across the country. The vaccine is now officially approved for all people 16 and older, making it the first to move beyond emergency-use status in the United States.

2/ **The Pentagon will require all military personnel to get a COVID-19 vaccine**. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is “prepared to issue updated guidance requiring all service members to be vaccinated,” according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. A timeline for when service members must receive the shot will be provided in the coming days.

3/ **New York City will require all public school teachers and staff to get vaccinated.** About 148,000 school employees — and contractors who work in schools — will have to get at least a first dose by Sept. 27, according to an announcement from the mayor and the city health and education departments.

4/ **The House committee investigating the Capitol riot plans to seek phone records from the day in question, including from members of Congress**. The committee is poised to send notices to various telecommunications companies requesting that they preserve the phone records of several people, the first step in an investigatory process that could eventually lead to witness testimony.

5/ **Democrats plan to vote to advance Biden's $3.5 trillion budget package**. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan to move the bill in tandem with the Senate-passed infrastructure legislation is threatened by a rebellion by moderate Democrats, who have insisted that the $550 billion infrastructure bill get a speedy vote and be signed into law before they consider the larger piece.
