1/ **House Democrats outlined their proposed tax increases on corporations and wealthy people to help offset the costs of Biden’s $3.5 trillion economic plan**. The House Ways and Means Committee plan calls for raising the corporate tax rate to 26.5% from 21%, a 3-percentage-point surcharge on individual income above $5 million, and raising the capital gains tax from 20% to 25%. White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the proposal “meets two core goals the President laid out at the beginning of this process: it does not raise taxes on Americans earning under $400,000 and it repeals the core elements of the Trump tax giveaways for the wealthy and corporations that have done nothing to strengthen our country’s economic health.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-release-details-of-tax-increase-11631539532?mod=hp_lead_pos1) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/12/corporate-tax-rate-511570) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/13/house-democrats-propose-tax-increases-in-3point5-trillion-budget-bill.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-12/house-democrats-set-to-propose-corporate-tax-rate-of-26-5?sref=MIBMEEoj))

2/ **Joe Manchin – again – said he will not support the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package to expand the nation's social safety net**, which includes investments in climate change, health care, taxes, and education. “I cannot support $3.5 trillion,” Manchin said, citing his opposition to the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate. Chuck Schumer "will not have my vote on the 3.5," Manchin said, adding "there's no way" Congress can meet the Sept. 27 deadline set by Nancy Pelosi for passage. Manchin added: “It's going to be $1, $1.5 \[trillion\]. We don't know where it's going to be. It’s not going to be at $3.5 \[trillion\], I can assure you.” Democrats need all 50 votes to pass the budget reconciliation package. Kyrsten Sinema, another moderate Democrat, has also expressed concern over the cost of the bill.

3/ **A group of leading U.S. and international scientists  suggested that Covid-19 vaccine booster shots are “not appropriate at this stage in the pandemic.”** The international group of scientists, which include some at the FDA and the WHO, concluded that "boosting" the vaccinated population doesn't outweigh the benefit of using those doses to immunize the billions of unvaccinated people worldwide. “None of the studies has provided credible evidence of substantially declining protection against severe disease,” the authors wrote, noting there could be side-effects if boosters are introduced too soon or too broadly. The group did, however, say that booster shots may eventually be needed for the general population if vaccine-induced immunity wanes or a new variant emerges that can evade the body's immune response. Several recent studies published by the CDC suggest that the vaccines hold steady against severe illness, including the Delta variant. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has proposed administering vaccine boosters eight months after the initial shots starting Sept. 20. A committee of FDA advisers is scheduled to meet on Friday to review the data.

4/ **The U.S. ranks last among the world’s seven wealthiest democracies in Covid-19 vaccination rate**. About 62% of Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Canada leads the G7 countries in vaccination rates, with almost 75% of its population at least partially vaccinated, followed by France (73%), Italy (72%), UK (71%), Germany (66%), and Japan (63%). The U.S. ranks sixth out of the Group of 7 nations, however, for fully vaccinated people – about 53%. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/us-vaccination-rate-low.html))

5/ **George W. Bush compared the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters to international extremists, warning that they are "children of the same foul spirit."** In a speech marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Bush said the U.S. has seen "growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within." Bush added that "it is our continuing duty to confront them."  Trump, meanwhile, called Bush “a failed and uninspiring \[president\]” who shouldn’t be “lecturing” Americans about the threat posed by domestic terrorism. Separately, Capitol Police plan to [install](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/13/politics/capitol-hill-fencing-returns/) temporary fencing around the Capitol ahead of a planned right-wing rally on Sept. 18. The "Justice for J6" rally is being [organized](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/09/08/day-232/#8-an-internal-capitol-police-memo-wa) by a former Trump campaign staffer in support of the jailed Jan. 6 rioters.

6/ **Capitol Police arrested a man armed with multiple knives, a bayonet, and a machete near the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington**. Donald Craighead told Capitol Police he was "on patrol" and began talking about white supremacist ideology and other rhetoric pertaining to white supremacy. His pickup truck also had a swastika and other White supremacist symbols painted on it.
