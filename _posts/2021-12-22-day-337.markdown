1/ **Biden announced that pandemic relief for federal student loan borrowers will be extended once again until May 1, 2022.** The extension affects about 41 million borrowers, including nearly 27 million who haven’t been paying their monthly bill since early in 2020.

2/ **The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the first pill for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in adults and children ages 12 and older.** The Pfizer pill, Paxlovid, is a faster way to treat early COVID-19 infections, though initial supplies will be extremely limited. All of the previously authorized drugs against the disease require an IV or an injection. "The efficacy is high, the side effects are low and it’s oral," said Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic. "It checks all the boxes." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-pfizer-medication-f5f65e7e61d6aa9c7dfa193053e8878a))

3/ **Corporate donations to Sen. Joe Manchin's PAC surged as he fought against Biden's agenda**. The political action committee received 17 contributions in October and 19 last month, according to a CNBC analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.

4/ **The House committee investigating the Capitol riot is seeking information about Rep. Jim Jordan's contact with Trump on Jan. 6.** Committee investigators want to ask Jordan about “possibly multiple communications” he had with Trump on the day of the invasion, according to a letter from committee chair Bennie Thompson. The Ohio Republican has emerged as the top conduit for GOP House members involved in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.

5/ **A judge rejected a bid by former Trump advisor Michael Flynn to block a subpoena for his Jan. 6 phone records a day after he filed suit.** Flynn claimed in federal court in Florida that the subpoena issued to him by the House Jan. 6 committee was too broad and that it punishes him for constitutionally protected speech as a private citizen. The judge, however, left the door open for Flynn to renew his bid if he thinks he can satisfy two issues that the judge cited in denying a restraining order against the committee.

6/ **A member of the Proud Boys pleaded guilty for his role in the Capitol riot**. Matthew Greene pleaded guilty in federal court to two criminal charges: conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding, related to the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021.
