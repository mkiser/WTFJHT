1/ **A group of historians warned Biden that the current moment in America is among the most dangerous to democracy in modern history**, comparing the threat to democracy to the pre-Civil War era and to pro-fascist movements before World War II. The group of scholars focused on the rise of totalitarianism around the world and the threat to American democracy.

2/ **Attorney General Merrick Garland "personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant" for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant**. Garland said he filed the motion to unseal both the warrant and the receipt that lists the items seized, citing the “substantial public interest” in the matter. Garland said the Justice Department "does not take such actions lightly" and first pursues "less intrusive" means to retrieve material, referring to the grand jury [subpoena](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/trump-fbi-subpoena.html) Trump [received](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/mar-a-lago-search-subpoena-latest/) this spring for classified documents he improperly took to Mar-a-Lago when he left the White House. Investigators reportedly believed that the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were so sensitive and related to national security that the Justice Department had to act.

4/ **The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average over the past 40 years**.

7/ **Rental costs in the U.S. are rising at their fastest pace in more than three decades**, with the median rent surpassing $2,000 a month for the first time ever. Over the past year, rent was up 6.3%. In the years before the pandemic, the cost of rent typically climbed 3.5% a year. Mortgage rates, meanwhile, jumped back above 5%, after briefly dipping below that level for the first time in months a week earlier. Last year, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 2.87%. About 40% of households – roughly 5.4 million households – that are not current on their rent or mortgage payments said they could face eviction or foreclosure in the next two months.
