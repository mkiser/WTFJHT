1/ **Weather models are warning of a "very dangerous" and "prolonged heat wave" over western states this week and into the Labor Day weekend**. More than 55 million people are currently under heat alerts in the west, including 20 of the most populated cities. More than 100 records could be broken. “We will very likely be in the midst of a full-fledged and potentially dangerous heat wave by midweek,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. "Record breaking or not, this prolonged heat wave is going to be very dangerous."

2/ **The Education Department will discharge another $1.5 billion in student debt for students who enrolled in Westwood College**. The Education Department found that 79,000 borrowers who attended Westwood College, a private, for-profit institution that closed in 2016, were “routinely misled” about their job prospects and expected earnings after graduation. The forgiveness will happen automatically, regardless of whether former students have applied for a borrower defense discharge, the Education Department said.

3/ **The Labor Department reported that there were 11.2 million job openings in July – up from the previous month’s 11 million and in excess of the 10.3 million estimated**. Job openings outnumber available workers by about a 2-to-1 margin and have remained above 10 million since the summer of 2021.

4/ **Lindsey Graham warned that there would be “riots in the street” if Trump is prosecuted for taking highly classified government documents to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House**. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre criticized the “dangerous” comments about violence from “extreme Republicans.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/29/lindsey-graham-riots/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/us/politics/lindsey-graham-trump-riots.html))

5/ **Trump demanded that the 2020 presidential election be declared “irreparably compromised” and that a new one be held “immediately!”** after news that Facebook temporarily limited a controversial story about Hunter Biden's laptop in users' news feeds before the 2020 election. Trump was responding to comments from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg made on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that the FBI had warned Facebook to be on the lookout for potential Russian misinformation on the platform. Nevertheless, the twice-impeached ex-president posted to his social media app, which is [currently](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/30/trump-truth-social-barred-from-google-play-store-content-moderation-concerns.html) [banned](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/30/trump-truth-social-google-android-moderation) from the Google Play Store because of insufficient content moderation, that he should be declared the winner of the election that was decided two years ago, saying “this would be the minimal solution, declare the 2020 Election irreparably compromised and have a new Election, immediately!” Trump, [meanwhile](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-qanon-truth-social-meltdown-1234584590/), spent Tuesday morning posting more than 60 inflammatory messages on social media, including many from QAnon accounts and 4chan.
