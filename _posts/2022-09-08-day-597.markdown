1/ **The Justice Department appealed a federal judge’s decision to grant a special master to review documents seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home**. [Earlier this week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/09/06/day-595/#2-a-federal-judge-granted-trump%E2%80%99s-re), U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon ordered the appointment of an independent attorney "to review the seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege." Prosecutors asked Cannon to exclude all documents with classification markings from any special master review and to put on hold her directive blocking the Justice Department from using the seized records for investigative purposes while they appeal her decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. In the filing, prosecutors wrote that allowing a special master to review the classified material would “cause the most immediate and serious harms to the government and the public.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/08/justice-appeals-trump-documents-special-master/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/08/doj-trump-special-master-appeal) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-appeal-judge-s-order-appointing-special-master-in-trump-mar-a-lago-probe-11662667299?mod=hp_lead_pos4) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-08/doj-to-appeal-ruling-for-special-master-on-trump-search-records?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/08/doj-appeals-special-master-ruling-in-trump-mar-a-lago-probe-00055686) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/us/politics/trump-special-master-doj.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/florida-donald-trump-mar-a-lago-government-and-politics-edc87319957149db117e931ac93fe5f8))

2/ **A federal grand jury issued subpoenas seeking information about Trump’s Save America PAC, which was formed after his 2020 election loss**. The Justice Department is investigating the activities leading up the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the election. Trump's Save America PAC raised more than $135 million after the election by baselessly asserting claims of voter fraud they knew were false while consistently pushing supporters to donate.

3/ **Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he is “strongly committed” to fighting inflation "until the job is done."** The central bank has raised interest rates four times this year from near zero in March to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% in July. Fed officials next meets Sept. 20-21, and Powell has kept the option open for a third consecutive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise. The average 30-year mortgage rate, meanwhile, climbed to 5.89% – the highest level since 2008. Last year at this time, the average mortgage rate was 2.88%.

4/ **Congress must pass a funding bill before Sept. 30 to avoid a government shutdown**. Bernie Sanders, however said he'd vote against the stopgap funding bill if Chuck Schumer follows through with a side deal he made with Joe Manchin to fast-track federal approvals of energy projects. Sanders said the permitting reform bill  is “a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry” and that the legislation would make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits and complete “some of the dirtiest and most polluting oil and gas projects in America.” In order to secure Manchin's support for the Inflation Reduction Act, Schumer promised to pass the permitting reform bill. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-08/sanders-says-he-ll-oppose-federal-funding-bill-over-manchin-deal?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3634171-sanders-vows-to-oppose-controversial-schumer-manchin-side-deal/))

5/ **The White House warned that the environmental impact of producing cryptocurrencies could threaten the nation’s climate goals**. A new report on the climate and energy implications of the crypto industry by the Office of Science and Technology Policy estimates that the industry is responsible for at least 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year – similar to the annual emissions of the entire U.S. railroad industry. The U.S. is responsible for 38% of the world’s Bitcoin mining, compared with 3.5% in 2020. While stopping short of prescribing specific regulations, the report urged federal agencies to work with states, communities, and industry to develop voluntary environmental performance standards.

6/ **Nearly 650,000 parcels of land in the U.S. are projected to be at least partially under water by 2050**, according to a new report by the nonprofit Climate Central. As much as 4.4 million acres could fall below tidal boundaries that mark the line between private property and public land by 2050, which could double by 2100. Louisiana, in particular, is expected to see roughly 8.7% of its total land area – nearly 2.5 million acres – fall wholly below tidal boundary lines by 2050. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/08/sea-level-rise-climate-central/) / [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2022-09-seas-fueled-climate-swamp-34b.html))

7/ **The Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean are warming nearly twice as fast as the global average**. Temperatures in the region are projected to rise up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. Europe, meanwhile, recorded its hottest summer in history – its second historic summer in a row.
