1/ **Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a challenge to Biden's student loan forgiveness program**. The challenge came from the Brown County Taxpayers Association in Wisconsin. Barrett, however, dismissed the case for lack of standing, ruling that paying taxes didn't give the group grounds to challenge the action taken by the federal government in this instance.

2/ **A federal appeals court ordered Lindsey Graham to appear before a Georgia grand jury investigating Trump for criminal interference in the state’s 2020 presidential election**. Graham had asked the court to block a subpoena from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, claiming that a sitting senator is shielded from such investigations. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, denied Graham’s request and upheld a lower-court ruling that he may be questioned about certain topics, saying “Senator Graham has failed to demonstrate that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal.” Graham is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to block the subpoena. [Separately](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/politics/kelly-loeffler-pat-cipollone-georgia-special-grand-jury/index.html), former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and former Senator Kelly Loeffler provided testimony to the grand jury in recent months.
