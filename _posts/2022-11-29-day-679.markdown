1/ **The Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act to codify federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages**. While the legislation doesn't force states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, it does require states to recognize all marriages that were legal where they were performed, and protect current same-sex unions. The bill also repeals the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. “For millions and millions of Americans, today is a very good day,” Chuck Schumer said prior to the vote. “An important day. A day that’s been a long time coming.” The bill’s passage sends it back to the House for another vote and then to Biden for his signature.

2/ **Congressional leaders vowed to pass legislation "ASAP" to avert a nationwide rail strike**, saying they agree with Biden that a railroad strike in the coming weeks would put the economy "at risk." A rail strike could happen as early as December 9. “I am calling on Congress to pass legislation immediately to adopt the Tentative Agreement between railroad workers and operators – without any modifications or delay – to avert a potentially crippling national rail shutdown,” Biden said in a statement. In September, the White House helped broker a tentative deal, but members of the largest unions rejected the proposal because it didn't address scheduling and paid time-off issues.

3/ **A federal jury convicted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes of seditious conspiracy** for plotting to forcefully disrupt the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Kelly Meggs, who ran the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers at the time of the Jan. 6 attack, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies. Seditious conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

4/ **Mark Meadows was ordered to testify to the grand jury investigating Trump’s effort to overturn the election in Georgia**. Meadows had asked the state supreme court to block a subpoena for testimony, arguing that his appearance before the grand jury was barred by executive privilege. “We have reviewed the arguments raised by \[Meadows\] and find them to be manifestly without merit,” the justices wrote in a brief opinion.

5/ **Kevin McCarthy disavowed the white nationalist Nick Fuentes, but declined to criticize Trump for having dinner with him**. “The president can have meetings with who he wants," McCarthy said. "I don’t think anybody, though, should have a meeting with Nick Fuentes," adding: "The president didn’t know who he was.” Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, suggested that Trump is "highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States" after dining with a white supremacist and Holocaust denier.
