1/ **Trump can be sued by injured Capitol Police officers and Democratic lawmakers over the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol**. In a federal court filing, the Justice Department said Trump is not entitled to absolute immunity against civil lawsuits seeking to hold him liable for the attack because “no part of a President’s official responsibilities includes the incitement of imminent private violence." Although Trump enjoys broad legal latitude to communicate to the public on matters of concern, attorneys for the Justice Department's civil division wrote that "by definition, such conduct plainly falls outside the President’s constitutional and statutory duties.” Two U.S. Capitol Police officers and 11 Democratic House members are seeking to hold Trump liable for injuries and damages caused during the riot. Trump has argued that he was acting in his official capacity as president when he told a crowd to "fight like hell" to keep Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.

2/ **The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into George Santos**, who has admitted to numerous fabrications about his background and faced questions about his campaign and personal finances. The probe will look at whether Santos "engaged in unlawful activity with respect to his 2022 congressional campaign," including allegations of sexual misconduct, failure to properly disclose information on his House financial disclosures, and whether he violated federal conflict of interest laws. Santos responded to the investigation, tweeting in third-person that "George Santos is fully cooperating."

3/ **Biden plans to ask Congress for $1.6 billion to recapture stolen Covid-19 relief funds and help victims of identity theft**. The Trump and Biden administrations distributed about $5 trillion in pandemic relief funds, and some experts estimate that more than a quarter of a trillion dollars were stolen by fraudsters. At least $2 billion has been recovered so far. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/02/covid-aid-fraud-biden-request/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-pitches-16-billion-plan-targeting-covid-relief-fraud-rcna73013) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-seeks-16-bln-tackle-covid-relief-fraud-ahead-republican-probes-2023-03-02/))

4/ **Eli Lilly will cap the out-of-pocket costs of insulin at $35 a month** – a 70% cut in the price of its most commonly prescribed insulin products. About 8.4 million people in the U.S. with diabetes rely on insulin in order to live, and the annual cost of medical care for people with diabetes runs $9,601 on average. Eli Lilly will cut the list price of its generic insulin to $25 a vial on May 1 – down from its current list price of $82.41 per vial. And for people with private insurance, the out-of-pocket costs will be capped at $35. Biden called the announcement as “a big deal.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eli-lilly-caps-cost-insulin-35-month-rcna72713) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/01/1160339792/eli-lilly-insulin-price) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/01/eli-lilly-insulin/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eli-lilly-to-cut-prices-of-insulin-drugs-by-70-c554f516?mod=hp_lead_pos2) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/health/eli-lilly-insulin-prices-diabetes/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/insulin-diabetes-humalog-humulin-prescription-drugs-eli-lilly-lantus-419db92bfe554894bdc9c7463f2f3183))

5/ **The Senate voted to repeal a Biden administration rule that allowed retirement funds to consider climate and social factors in their investments decisions**. Republicans have complained that the rule is a “woke” policy that politicizes retirement investments by pushing liberal environmental and social goals on Americans. Republicans have also argued that the rule would lead to disinvestment from the fossil fuel industry. The rule, however, is not a mandate to consider the environmental, social, and governance factors in investment selections. It was intended to reverse Trump-era policy that discouraged ESG investments. Nevertheless, Senate Republicans, with the help Jon Tester and Joe Manchin, passed the resolution the by a vote of 50 to 46 – a day after the House voted to rescind the rule. Biden, meanwhile, has threatened to veto the measure.
