1/ **The Manhattan grand jury hearing evidence about Trump’s role in the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels will not consider the matter again until at least Monday**. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to give details of the investigation, and it was unclear whether the grand jury was hearing witness testimony or reviewing other evidence today. Last week, Trump declared that he would be arrested Tuesday. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/23/trump-grand-jury-delay-monday/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/nyregion/trump-grand-jury-indictment-delay.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/23/potential-trump-indictment-pushed-00088522))

2/ **The Manhattan district attorney called demands by three House Republican leaders to force his testimony about his criminal investigation into Trump “an unprecedented inquiry into a pending local prosecution.”** The District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office rejected the House Republicans' request for documents and testimony, saying they lacked a “legitimate basis for congressional inquiry” and that their requests for information “only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene.” In a five-page letter to Jim Jordan and other House Republicans,  Bragg said their request “treads into territory very clearly reserved to the states” and would be an inappropriate use of congressional power.

3/ **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen backtracked on the prospect that regulators would not extend deposit insurance to protect the banking system**. [Yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-22/yellen-to-stress-no-protections-for-bank-owners-and-bondholders?sref=MIBMEEoj), Yellen made a point of saying she had not considered or discussed temporarily expanding emergency federal insurance – or as she called it, "blanket insurance" – to all U.S. banking deposits without approval by Congress. Yellen, however, testified today before a House Appropriations subcommittee that federal emergency actions could be deployed again in the future if necessary, saying: “We have used important tools to act quickly to prevent contagion. And they are tools we could use again. Regional bank stocks fell Wednesday following comments Yellen made at a Senate hearing that afternoon. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-23/yellen-says-us-prepared-for-additional-deposit-actions-if-needed?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/yellen-says-treasury-is-ready-to-take-additional-actions-if-warranted-to-stabilize-banks.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-working-restore-capacity-designate-non-bank-finance-institutions-systemic-2023-03-22/))

4/ **A hospital in Idaho will stop delivering babies or providing other obstetrical care due recently enacted state laws "that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care."** After the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, Idaho banned nearly all abortions and subjected physicians to prosecution for providing abortions, even if needed to protect the health of a pregnant patient. A physician who violates the law face two to five years in prison, along with their medical license being suspended or revoked. Bonner General Health in Sandpoint will discontinue obstetrical services in mid-May, meaning patients will now have to drive 46 miles for labor and delivery care. The Sandpoint area averages annual snowfall of about 60 inches.

5/ **Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill to ban most gender-affirming care for minors**. Senate Bill 140 bars doctors in Georgia from providing minors with hormone therapy or surgery related to gender transition. Physician who violate the law risk losing their license. The bill will take effect July 1. Kemp skipped the bill signing ceremony, in part, because he's a total clown. Instead, he announced the signing on Twitter.
