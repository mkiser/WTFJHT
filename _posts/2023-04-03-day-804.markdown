1/ **The Justice Department obtained new evidence in the Mar-a-Lago documents case that suggests potential obstruction by Trump**. Federal investigators have reportedly gathered new evidence that boxes containing classified material were moved from a Mar-a-Lago storage area after the subpoena from the Justice Department was served, and that Trump personally examined some of those boxes and documents. The additional evidence is based on witness statements, security camera footage, and emails and text messages from a former Trump aide.

2/ **Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News will go to trial** following a ruling by Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, who said it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations made by Fox hosts and guests in the weeks after the election were true. Fox News had argued that the First Amendment protected the comments and opinions made on its air alleging that the election had somehow been stolen. “It appears oxymoronic to call the statements ‘opinions' while also asserting the statements are newsworthy allegations and/or substantially accurate reports of official proceedings,” Davis said. The trial is expected to begin in mid-April.

3/ **Ron DeSantis signed legislation to allow Floridians to carry a concealed loaded weapon without a permit**. The new law will allow anyone who can legally own a gun in Florida to carry one without a permit. No training or background checks will be required to carry concealed guns in public. The governor signed the bill in a private ceremony in his office with only bill sponsors, legislative leaders and gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, in attendance. Florida is the 26th state to pass some form of permitless carry legislation. The new law takes effect July 1.

4/ **Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage** as Covid-19 public health emergency safety net comes to an end. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 15 million people – roughly 1 in 6 people on Medicaid – will lose Medicaid insurance. Nearly half of those who lose coverage will be Black or Hispanic. During the public health emergency, states were required to keep people on Medicaid. As of Saturday that prohibition ended and states can begin removing people from the government health insurance rolls. Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia are expected to start their disenrollment process this month.

5/ **Trump arrived in New York to surrender himself to authorities for his arraignment on hush-money charges**. Trump is the first sitting or former U.S. president to be indicted after a Manhattan grand jury voted to [formally accuse](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/03/30/day-800/#1-the-manhattan-grand-jury-voted-to) him of a crime related to his role in the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign. Trump will be arraigned, fingerprinted, and photographed around 2:15 p.m. Tuesday. The indictment itself, which describes the exact charges filed against Trump, is also expected to be unsealed Tuesday. Trump is facing multiple charges of falsifying business records, including at least one felony offense. “WITCH HUNT, as our once great Country is going to HELL!” Trump wrote on his personal social media platform.
