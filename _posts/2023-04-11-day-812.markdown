1/ **Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg sued Jim Jordan to keep the House Judiciary Committee from interfering in his prosecution of Trump**. In a 50-page lawsuit, Bragg describes a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” his office by Jordan and others, calling it “an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack” by members of Congress on the prosecution and investigation of Trump. The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena last week to Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor involved in the criminal investigation of Trump. Bragg is seeking a court order to bar Pomerantz from complying with the subpoena.

2/ **Trump appealed a judge’s order requiring Pence to testify before the grand jury investigating his efforts to overturn the 2020 election**. Trump is seeking to narrow the scope of the testimony that Pence has to give a grand jury, while also accusing the Justice Department of “attempting to destroy the long accepted, long held, Constitutionally based standards of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.” Trump has lost several attempts in court to block other top officials from his administration from testifying based on claims of executive privilege.

3/ **Biden formally ended the Covid-19 national emergency**, which was first enacted by the Trump administration in 2020. Biden signed the bipartisan congressional resolution behind closed doors despite publicly opposing the bill, saying it “would be a grave disservice to the American people.” The ending of the national emergency does not, however, affect the public health emergency, which underpins Title 42 – the border policy that allows the expulsion of migrants from U.S. borders without the opportunity to seek asylum. That policy is set to expire on May 11. The coronavirus has killed more than 1.13 million people in the U.S. and disrupted the global economy.

4/ **The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for the global economy**, noting “the recent increase in financial market volatility.” The IMF now expects the global economic growth to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. The IMF also expects growth to hover around 3% for the next five years – its weakest medium-term growth forecast since 1990. The warning follows the failure of two U.S. banks last month, and UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse in Europe. “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,” the organization said in its latest World Economic Outlook report. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, meanwhile, shrugged off the recent banking turmoil, saying "I’m not anticipating a downturn in the economy, although of course that remains a risk.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/business/imf-world-economic-outlook/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/banks-creating-downside-risks-for-global-growth-imf-chief-economist-.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/business/economy/imf-world-economic-outlook.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-11/yellen-plays-down-banking-woes-says-world-economy-has-improved?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-volatility-to-cut-u-s-gdp-imf-expects-6c043526?mod=hp_lead_pos2))

Dept. of Mass Confusion/ **I don't know where or how to start with summarizing this story about leaked classified U.S. military and intelligence documents** and could use your help deciphering this complicated story. From what I can gather, [more than 100 documents](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/us/politics/classified-documents-leak.html) that detail [national security secrets](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-says-it-is-reviewing-social-media-posts-that-purport-to-reveal-classified-documents-on-ukraine-4d7524f?mod=djemalertNEWS) – some labeled “Top Secret” – related to Ukraine, the Middle East, and China were recently leaked on social media. The documents in question are [photographs of printed reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/us/politics/leaked-documents-russia-ukraine-war.html) from a classified briefing. They appear to have been folded up, put in a pocket, and then taken out of a secure area to be photographed. Some documents were specifically marked for [U.S. eyes only](https://www.nytimes.com/article/leaked-documents-ukraine-russia-war.html), meaning it's likely that an American official leaked the information. The Justice Department has since opened an [investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/07/pentagon-leak-ukraine-documents/) into the leak of the “[highly sensitive, classified](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-10/doj-is-investigating-leaked-defense-documents-on-ukraine-allies?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj)” documents. The government's current "[working theory](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-reviewing-leak-classified-documents-ukraine-war-strength-rcna78771)" is that the documents are authentic but were [selectively edited](https://news.yahoo.com/tranche-of-purported-us-and-allied-military-secrets-leaked-online-in-possible-major-intelligence-breach-222137286.html) before being leaked. Congress, [meanwhile](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/11/congress-classified-document-leak-00091405), has requested classified briefings. Send help.
