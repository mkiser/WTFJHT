1/ **Four members of the Proud Boys were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol** and their use of force to stop the certification of the election. A jury deliberated for seven days before finding Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, and Zachary Rehl guilty on seditious conspiracy and other charges, including three separate conspiracy charges, obstructing the Electoral College vote, and tampering with evidence.  The men were convicted of at least one count punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

2/ **The special counsel investigating Trump's mishandling of classified documents sent new grand jury subpoenas to top Trump employees for information about the handling of Mar-a-Lago surveillance footage**. Trump Organization executives Matthew Calamari Sr. and his son Matthew Calamari Jr. are expected to appear today before the grand jury investigating. Calamari Sr. is the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Trump Organization. He's overseen security operations for Trump and his properties. Calamari Jr. is the director of security for the Trump Organization. It was [previously reported](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/10/13/day-632/#3-security-camera-footage-shows-a-tr) that footage captured a Trump aide and another Mar-a-Lago employee moving boxes containing documents out of a storage closet.

3/ **A New York Supreme Court judge dismissed Trump's lawsuit against the New York Times**. [In 2021](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/09/22/day-246/#6-trump-filed-a-100-million-lawsuit), Trump filed a $100 million lawsuit against the New York Times and his niece Mary Trump, claiming the news outlet's [2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/10/02/day-621/#1-trump-inherited-his-family%E2%80%99s-wealt) into his tax records was "an insidious plot to obtain confidential and highly-sensitive records." New York Supreme Court Justice Robert Reed, however, said Trump's claims "fail as a matter of constitutional law." Reed ordered Trump to pay all legal fees associated with the case.

4/ **A Republican megadonor paid for two years of private school tuition for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s great nephew**. Thomas did not disclose the gift from Harlan Crow, who also treated Thomas to lavish vacations for over two decades. Thomas had taken legal custody of the boy at the time and was "raising him as a son," but never disclosed that Crow was paying the $6,000-per-month bill for Hidden Lake Academy on his annual financial disclosures.

5/ **Republican lawmakers in the North Carolina House approved legislation that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks**, sending it to the state Senate for approval. The Care for Women, Children and Families Act would restrict the state's ban on abortions from 20 weeks to 12 weeks, and includes exceptions for rape or incest, fatal fetal anomalies, and to protect the life of the mother. Although Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has vowed to veto the bill, Republicans have a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers.
