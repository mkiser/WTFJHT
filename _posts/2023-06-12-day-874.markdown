1/ **Trump vowed to continue running for president even if he's convicted as part of the 37-count federal felony indictment**, saying “I’ll never leave.” Trump, who is not legally prohibited from running for president from prison or as a convicted felon, cast the charges as part of his “final battle” with a “corrupt” and "weaponized Department of Injustice." Trump's remarks at the Georgia Republican Party’s annual convention came one day after special counsel Jack Smith unsealed the 37-count federal indictment, which he called "a political hit job" by a "deranged" Smith. "In the end, they're not coming after me. They're coming after you," Trump said. "I'm just standing in their way."

* **📌 [Day 871](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/06/09/day-871/#1-the-justice-department-charged-tru): The Justice Department charged Trump with 37 felony counts over his refusal to return classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago**, including 31 counts under the Espionage Act of “willful retention” of national defense information, making false statements, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

2/ **A Montana judge will hear arguments in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit by 16 young people challenging Montana's pro-fossil fuel policies**. In Held v. Montana, the group accuse the state of violating their right to a “clean and healthful environment,” which is explicitly guaranteed in the state constitution, by promoting fossil fuel development. The trial started today and is scheduled to last two weeks.

3/ **More than 725,000 Medicaid recipients have lost coverage since the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency**. The federal pandemic-era policy required state Medicaid agencies to provide coverage, even if their eligibility changed. Since April, 14 states have started disenrolling people from Medicaid, with another 22 states starting the disenrollment processes this month. An estimated 17 million people could lose Medicaid coverage.

4/ **U.S. spy agencies have bought a “large amount” of “sensitive and intimate information” on Americans**, according to new report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Although most of the commercially available data from cars, phones, web tracking technologies, the Internet of Things, and more has been stripped of personal information and anonymized, the government said it's trivial “to deanonymize and identify individuals.” The report notes that the government can “persistently” track the phones of “millions of Americans” without a warrant so long as it purchases the information, adding “The government would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their reading habits.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-spy-agencies-buy-vast-quantities-of-americans-personal-data-report-says-f47ec3ad) / [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/?redirectURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fodni-commercially-available-information-report%2F))
