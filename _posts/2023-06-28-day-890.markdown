1/ **Roughly 87 million people in 17 states ‚Äì representing nearly a third of the American population ‚Äì are at risk for poor air quality as smoke from the Canadian wildfires spreads**. Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh were among the cities with the worst air quality in the world, leading the EPA to warn ‚Äúeveryone should stay indoors‚Äù as the air quality indexes fell into the ‚Äúvery unhealthy‚Äù category. The smoke is the result of one of Canada‚Äôs worst wildfire seasons in decades, with more than 19 million acres of land already burned this year. There were nearly 500 active wildfires burning in Canada as of this morning, with more than 250 burning out of control. Wildfires in the U.S. have been growing in frequency, duration, and intensity due in part to human-caused climate change. The United Nations has also warned that a similar trend is occurring worldwide. Elsewhere, another 69 million people face heat alerts in the South, Southeast, and parts of the Midwest and California.

2/ **Trump sued E. Jean Carroll for defamation after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed her**. Trump alleges that Carroll defamed him the day after the jury awarded her $5 million in damages when she said she Trump raped her. The federal jury had found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, but not raping her. Trump ‚Äúhas been the subject of significant harm to his reputation, which, in turn, has yielded an inordinate amount of damages sustained as a result,‚Äù according to the filing. He wants Carroll to pay him unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, as well as to retract multiple statements. Meanwhile, a New York judge earlier this month allowed Carroll to amend her defamation lawsuit against Trump, letting her to seek additional damages after Trump repeated statements the jury found to be defamatory after the verdict.
