1/ **The Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions**, undercutting 45 years of legal precedent. In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the court's conservative majority held that the admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina relied on racial considerations in violation of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause because they lacked sufficient "measurable objectives" justifying the use of race. Chief Justice John Roberts said the programs “unavoidably employ race in a negative manner.” Many universities “have concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin,” Roberts added. “Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-affirmative-action-college-race-f83d6318017ec9b9029b12ee2256e744) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/live-updates/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-unc#supreme-court-rules-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions-is-unconstitutional) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-supreme-court-ruling/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/29/us/affirmative-action-supreme-court) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-affirmative-action-programs-harvard-unc-rcna66770) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/politics/affirmative-action-supreme-court-ruling/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/supreme-court-rejects-affirmative-action-at-colleges-says-schools-cant-consider-race-in-admission.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/supreme-court-sharply-curbs-use-of-race-in-college-admissions?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/supreme-court-ends-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions-00104179) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-sets-new-limits-affirmative-action-programs/story?id=99230954) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-college-admissions-harvard-north-carolina/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-against-affirmative-action-c94b5a9c))

* **💡 Why should I care?** College affirmative action programs promote fairness, diversity, and equal opportunities in education, which research has shown to foster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. By addressing the imbalances caused by discrimination we ensure that students from historically marginalized groups have equal access to education. Without these programs, historically marginalized groups face greater barriers in accessing higher education, which perpetuates existing inequalities, limits social mobility, and hinders progress towards a more equitable society. Affirmative action programs aim to create a more inclusive society by breaking cycles of disadvantage and works towards building a society that values diversity, equal opportunities, and the potential of all individuals.

2/ **Biden assailed the Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action in college admissions, calling it a "severe disappointment" because "discrimination still exists in America."** He added: "Today’s decision does not change that. It’s a simple fact.” When asked whether the decision should make people question the Supreme Court's legitimacy and if this was a "rogue court," Biden responded after several seconds: "This is not a normal court." The Biden administration said it would provide guidance on how colleges could maintain diversity without violating the ruling. "We cannot let this decision be the last word,” Biden said. “The court can render a decision but it cannot change what America stands for.” Trump, meanwhile, praised the decision as a “great day for America.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/live-blog/supreme-court-decisions-live-updates-rcna91671#rcrd15142) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/biden-supreme-court-affirmative-action.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-supreme-court-affirmative-action-decision/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/biden-criticizes-supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-supreme-court-affirmative-action-decision-word/story?id=100491437))

3/ **The Supreme Court's liberal justices blasted the court’s decision on affirmative action, warning that it “makes things worse, not better” for the country**. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson accused the court's conservative majority of a "let-them-eat-cake obliviousness," saying "the majority pulls the ripcord and announces ‘colorblindness for all’ by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life." In a lengthy dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the court's majority was “further entrenching racial inequality in education" and never made an "attempt to make the extraordinary showing required” to reverse precedent. “The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated.” Sotomayor is the court’s lone Latina justice.
