1/ **Trump pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired to overturn the 2020 election results to keep himself in power**. It was the third time in four months Trump stood before a judge on criminal charges. Trump will remain free while the case moves forward, but was prohibited from speaking to any a witness about the case except through his lawyers. Following the hearing, Trump claimed that "this is a very sad day for America. This is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America." The next hearing in Trump’s 2020 election conspiracy case was set for Aug. 28 – days after the first debate in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.
