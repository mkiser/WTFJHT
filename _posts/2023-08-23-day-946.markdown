1/ **Rudy Giuliani surrendered to Georgia authorities and was booked on charges that he illegally conspired to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in the state**. Giuliani, who was released on $150,000 bond, told reporters that he was "very, very honored to be involved in this case because this case is a fight for our way of life. This indictment is a travesty.” He added: “If they can do this to me, they can do this to you." Meanwhile, Trump-allied Sidney Powell also surrendered to authorities at the Fulton County Jail. Trump is expected to surrender on Thursday.

2/ **A key witness in Trump's classified documents case "retracted his prior false testimony" and implicated Trump and others in obstruction of justice after switching lawyers**. Yuscil Taveras' legal expenses were previously paid for by Trump's Save America PAC. He initially testified to a grand jury that he was unaware of any effort at Mar-a-Lago to delete security footage. After hiring a new lawyer from the federal defender's office in Washington in early July, Taveras – described as “Trump Employee 4” in court documents – changed his testimony and detailed the alleged effort by Trump, Carlos De Oliveira, and Walt Nauta to tamper with evidence. Prosecutors then filed [additional charges](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/07/31/day-923/#3-special-counsel-jack-smith-accused) on July 27, accusing Trump, Nauta, and de Oliveira of alleged attempts to pressure "Trump Employee 4" to delete the security footage. Taveras has not been charged in the case.

3/ **The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a ban on most abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy**. The ”Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act” bans abortion after embryonic cardiac activity can be detected, which is generally around six weeks of pregnancy. South Carolina previously allowed abortion until 22 weeks. The 4-1 decision reverses the court's January ruling, which struck down a similar law on the basis that it violated the State Constitution’s protections for privacy. The new ruling comes after Republican state lawmakers replaced the lone woman on the court, who retired because of the court’s age limits, with a male justice, and then passed a new six-week abortion ban. South Carolina is the only state to have an all-male state supreme court despite a [population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/SC#) that's 51.3% female.

4/ **The first Republican presidential debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern time tonight**. Eight candidates will appear onstage in Milwaukee: Doug Burgum, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tim Scott. Trump, the current frontrunner for the Republican nomination, will not be at the debate. Instead, Trump will sit for an interview with Tucker Carlson, which he [reportedly already recorded](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/21/day-944/#2-trump-confirmed-that-he%E2%80%99ll-skip-th). The two-hour event, moderated by Fox News Channel hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, will air exclusively on Fox News and the Fox Business Network, as well as on Fox’s website and digital platforms. It will not be simulcast across other networks or cable channels. Burgum, [meanwhile](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/23/burgum-debate-leg-injury/), suffered a high-grade tear of his Achilles tendon while playing pick-up basketball with his staff yesterday said he will still participate in the debate.
