1/ **Trump will surrender at the Fulton County jail on 13 state charges that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia** – it's the fourth time this year that Trump will have turned himself in to face criminal charges. Trump will also be fingerprinted and a mugshot taken – a first in his four separate criminal cases. Trump and 18 political allies were indicted [last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/15/day-938/#1-trump-and-18-others-were-indicted) as part of a racketeering case accusing them of engaging in a “criminal enterprise” to “unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump.” He is facing 13 separate felony counts in Georgia, including violating the state’s anti-racketeering act, soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, conspiring to impersonate a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, and conspiring to file false documents. [Prior](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/24/trump-georgia-lawyer-sadow-00112732) to his surrender, Trump [replaced](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/us/trump-georgia-lawyers.html) his top Georgia lawyer, [adding](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/donald-trump-to-turn-himself-in-at-fulton-county-jail-in-georgia-aa43b825?mod=hp_lead_pos2) Steve Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer who has previously challenged the state’s racketeering law. Sadow [replaces](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/trump-changes-lawyers-in-georgia-election-case-ahead-of-arrest.html) Drew Findling, who [helped](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/politics/trump-georgia-lawyer/index.html) negotiate Trump’s $200,000 bond in the case. \[*Editor's note: At the time publishing, Trump was en route to Fulton County to turn himself in.

* **📌 [Day 800](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/03/30/day-800/#1-the-manhattan-grand-jury-voted-to): The Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump for his role in the hush-money payment to a porn star during his 2016 campaign**.

* **📌 [Day 871](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/06/09/day-871/#1-the-justice-department-charged-tru): The Justice Department charged Trump with 37 felony counts over his refusal to return classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago**, including 31 counts under the Espionage Act of “willful retention” of national defense information, making false statements, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

* **📌 [Day 924](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/01/day-924/#1-trump-was-indicted-by-special-coun): Trump was indicted by special counsel Jack Smith on federal charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election** and subvert the will of American voters.

* **📌 [Day 938](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/15/day-938/#1-trump-and-18-others-were-indicted) Trump and 18 others were indicted by an Atlanta grand jury in connection with efforts to overturn Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia**. The 41-count indictment – 13 of which were lodged against Trump – is the fourth time Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has been indicted since leaving office. In all, he faces 91 felony charges.

2/ **Mark Meadows surrendered at the Fulton County Jail for his alleged role in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia** after a federal judge rejected his effort to move the case from state court to federal court. Meadows claims his case should be handled by the federal courts because it involves his work for the Trump administration. Meadows faces two counts: violating Georgia's anti-racketeering law and soliciting a public officer to violate their oath. The judge set his bond at $100,000.

3/ **Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked a state judge to schedule Trump’s racketeering trial for Oct. 23, 2023** – about five months earlier than her original March 2024 proposal. Willis made the request in response to a demand by another defendant in the case, Kenneth Chesebro, for a speedier trial. “Without waiving any objection as to the sufficiency of Defendant Kenneth John Chesebro’s filing, the State requests that this Court specially set the trial in this case to commence on October 23, 2023, which falls within the term of the ‘next succeeding regular court term,’” Willis wrote. Trump, meanwhile, said he’s opposes the October trial date and said he’d seek to separate his case from Chesebro. Fulton Judge Scott McAfee granted Chesebro’s requqest for an Oct. 23 trial, and set his arraignment for Sept. 6.

4/ **Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis**, accusing her of coordinating with Biden administration officials. In a letter to Willis, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan wrote that “your indictment and prosecution implicate substantial federal interests, and the circumstances surrounding your actions raise serious concerns about whether they are politically motivated.” The Republican-led committee claims that the allocation of funds appropriated by Congress gives them jurisdiction over the state-level probe. They're seeking documents and other material from Willis, including any communications with the Justice Department and whether any federal dollars were used in her investigation that resulted in Trump's fourth indictment.

5/ **U.S. intelligence concluded that an intentional explosion or some other form of sabotage caused the plane crash that killed Yevgeny Prigozhin**, the Russian mercenary leader who led a failed uprising against Putin two months ago. Prigozhin was listed as a passenger on the jet that crashed north of Moscow yesterday. Although a definitive conclusion has not been reached, there is no evidence that the plane he was on was taken down by a missile. Putin, meanwhile, expressed his condolences to the families of those killed, adding that Prigozhin was “a man of difficult fate” who had “made serious mistakes in life."
