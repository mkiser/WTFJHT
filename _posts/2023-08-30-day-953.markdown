1/ **Georgia Senate Republicans are considering ways to punish District Attorney Fani Willis for indicting Trump and 18 other defendants**, saying "we believe she is definitely tainted." State Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch threatened hold legislative hearings to investigate Willis, accusing her of "politicizing" her 51-count indictment accusing Trump and 18 co-defendants of a “criminal enterprise” to reverse the 2020 election results. Gooch also suggested that Republicans could take advantage of a new law, Senate Bill 92, which allows a state panel to investigate and remove prosecutors. He called it a powerful "tool in the toolbox." Meanwhile, Georgia state Senator Colton Moore suggested that a civil war could break out over Trump's prosecution, saying “we’ve got 19 people who are facing the rest of their life in prison because they spoke out against an election.” In a separate interview, Moore called Willis a “domestic threat.” ([Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/georgia-senate-leader-seeking-ways-to-sanction-tainted-willis-over-trump-charges/PP34EF3CS5B77F5XJ3WMTAW7KQ/) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colton-moore-trump-civil-war_n_64ef1259e4b01033a8287fb5) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-brian-kemp-georgia-indictment-2d3cc1b7f5a63e2c331daed85ee8b2e0))

2/ **A federal judge ruled that Rudy Giuliani was liable for defaming two Georgia election workers when he repeatedly accused them of manipulating ballots while counting votes in Atlanta during the 2020 election**. U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell imposed the default judgment and monetary punishment after Giuliani repeatedly failed to comply with her orders to turn over documents and other evidence. Howell accused Giuliani of “willful \[...\] misconduct” and “slippery” statements in violating her orders to preserve and produce relevant evidence. The ruling means the case will now proceed to a trial to determine how much Giuliani will have to pay in damages to the two election workers.

3/ **Mitch McConnell – again – froze during a news conference and was unable to respond for more than 30 seconds after being asked if he would run for re-election**. McConnell chuckled and began to answer the question when he abruptly stopped speaking, standing motionless and staring ahead for more than 30 seconds. When an aide stepped in to ask if he'd heard the question, McConnell remained unresponsive. “I’m sorry you all, we’re gonna need a minute,” the aide told reporters. In July, McConnell [froze and went silent for 19 seconds](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/07/27/day-919/#3-mitch-mcconnell-was-escorted-away) before being escorted away from the cameras. He returned shortly afterward and continued his news conference, claiming he's “fine.” The 81-year-old, however, fell two weeks prior to the July incident and has been using a wheelchair periodically to get around. McConnell also suffered a concussion after falling down earlier this year.

4/ **The Biden administration proposed a new rule that would extend overtime pay to 3.6 million more U.S. workers**. Workers making less than about $55,000 annually would be automatically entitled to time-and-a-half pay under the Department of Labor proposal – up from $35,568 set in 2019 under Trump. The median full-time worker in the U.S. makes around $57,000 a year.

5/ **Gov. Ron DeSantis rejected some $350 million in federal energy efficiency incentives for Florida** – the only governor to block the Inflation Reduction Act energy rebates. If Florida doesn’t apply for the rebates by next August, the law allows the Energy Department to allocate Florida’s money to other states. DeSantis has also rejected an additional $3 million in IRA funding to help the state fight pollution, vetoed the federal Solar for All program, and turned down $24 million in grants from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 47.9% of Americans have a [unfavorable opinion](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/ron-desantis/) of DeSantis.
