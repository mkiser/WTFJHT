1/ **Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis accused Jim Jordan of trying to obstruct her prosecution of Trump and his 18 co-defendants** for their efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Last month, Jordan and other Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee [demanded](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/24/day-947/#4-republicans-on-the-house-judiciary) that Willis turn over all documents related to her prosecution of Trump, accusing her of coordinating with Biden administration officials. “There is no justification in the Constitution for Congress to interfere with a state criminal matter, as you attempt to do,” Willis said, adding that "the obvious purpose" of Jordan's request "is to obstruct a Georgia criminal proceeding and to advance outrageous partisan misrepresentations."

* **Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked a judge to keep jurors’ names secret**. Willis also asked that courtroom cameras not show the jurors and bar the publication of written descriptions of the people on a jury after grand jurors, who issued the indictment against Trump and his allies, were doxed online.

2/ **Trump notified the judge overseeing his Georgia election subversion case that he “may” try to move the state case into federal court**. He would be the sixth defendant to file such a motion, joining Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, David Shafer, Cathy Latham, and Shawn Still. Trump now has a month to file a formal notice of removal of the case to federal court in Georgia.

3/ **Trump was warned in May 2022 that the FBI could search Mar-a-Lago if he didn't comply with a grand jury subpoena for the return of all the classified documents**. Minutes after Trump's lawyer, Evan Corcoran, told Trump he needed to comply with the subpoena, a different Trump attorney warned him that Trump is "just going to go ballistic" if he's pushed to comply with the subpoena. On Aug. 8, 2022, the FBI [executed a federal search warrant](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/08/09/day-567/#1-the-fbi-executed-a-federal-search) at Mar-a-Lago and recovered more than 100 classified documents. A Mar-a-Lago IT worker, meanwhile, struck a cooperation agreement with Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office to provide testimony. Yuscil Taveras [previously](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/23/day-946/#2-a-key-witness-in-trump%E2%80%99s-classifie) “retracted his prior false testimony” and implicated Trump and others in obstruction of justice.

4/ **A Trump trade adviser was convicted of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol**. Peter Navarro was convicted of two counts of criminal contempt of Congress, each punishable by up to a year behind bars and a fine of up to $100,000. Navarro is the second former Trump aide to be prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the committee. Steve Bannon was [convicted last year](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/07/25/day-552/#11-steve-bannon-was-found-guilty-of) on two contempt counts.
