1/ **Kevin McCarthy directed three House committees to open an impeachment inquiry into Biden as far-right Republican lawmakers threaten to remove him as speaker**. McCarthy said the impeachment inquiry would center on whether Biden benefited from Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere despite investigations led by Republicans on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees having not uncovered any direct evidence that Biden personally benefited from his son’s business dealings. Notably, McCarthy did not announce a full House vote to open the inquiry and it's unclear if he has the 218 votes needed to launch a formal inquiry. Several centrist Republican lawmakers oppose the effort. McCarthy, meanwhile, is trying to secure enough votes from far-right Republicans – who have been pushing for a Biden impeachment – to keep the government funded beyond the Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a shutdown. A single Republican, however, can bring a no-confidence vote to the floor to remove McCarthy as speaker, and less than an hour after the announcement Matt Gaetz accused McCarthy of violating the power-sharing agreement he made with the far-right to be elected speaker in January. Gaetz threatened to bring a motion to vacate against McCarthy if he puts a short-term spending bills on the floor instead of holding votes on balancing the budget and term limits. Marjorie Taylor Greene also said she wouldn't vote to fund the government unless the House opened a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden. The White House called the impeachment inquiry “extreme politics at its worst.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/12/mccarthy-biden-impeachment/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/us/politics/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-inquiry.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-inquiry-b9cc6530) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-mccarthy-expected-endorse-impeachment-inquiry-president-biden/story?id=103114626) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/12/1198922531/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-inquiry) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/politics/biden-impeachment-house-gop/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/gop-house-speaker-mccarthy-endorses-biden-impeachment-inquiry.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/kevin-mccarthy-plans-formally-endorse-impeachment-inquiry-biden-rcna104585) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-shutdown-house-republicans-b187202be8814f7acbdd6e2e937e23d4) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/12/mccarthy-biden-impeachment-government-shutdown-00115248) / [Punchbowl News](https://punchbowl.news/archive/91223-punchbowl-news-am/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-12/mccarthy-to-endorse-biden-impeachment-inquiry?sref=MIBMEEoj))

* **Kevin McCarthy faces a 'perfect storm' of demands as a shutdown looms**. "With a Sept. 30 deadline, the House speaker confronts right-wing demands to cut spending, limit migration, prop up Trump and impeach Biden — and veiled threats to his gavel."

2/ **A group of Minnesota voters filed a lawsuit seeking to block Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot in the state**, citing the “insurrection clause” of the 14th Amendment. It's the [second lawsuit](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/09/06/day-960/#5-six-voters-in-colorado-filed-a-law) in the past month to try to keep Trump off the ballot in next year's presidential race under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

3/ **Trump demanded that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan recuse herself from presiding over his election subversion case**. Trump's attorneys claim she made “disqualifying” statements while sentencing two people for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack when she said: "This was nothing less than an attempt to violently overthrow the government, the legally, lawfully, peacefully elected government, by individuals who were mad that their guy lost [...] it's blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day." Ultimately, the law leaves it up to Chutkan to decide whether her “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” or she has “a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/11/trump-chutkan-recusal-jan-6-judge/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-justice-department-jan-6-special-counsel-3e5039d9d9bb5f47282ba517de5f0e7d) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-asks-judge-tanya-chutkan-jan-6-case-to-recuse-herself/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/11/trump-seeks-removal-of-federal-judge-from-dc-elections-case.html))

4/ **Child poverty in the U.S. more than doubled last year**, rising to 12.4% in 2022 from a record low of 5.2% in 2021. The overall poverty rate rose to 12.4% in 2022 from 7.8% in 2021. The spike follows two years of declines that coincided with record inflation and the expiration of Covid-era safety net programs, such as an expanded child tax credit, direct payments to households, enhanced unemployment and nutrition benefits, and increased rental assistance. The expanded child tax credits in particular are credited with lifting millions of children out of poverty and driving down the child poverty rate to a record low of 5.2% in 2021.
