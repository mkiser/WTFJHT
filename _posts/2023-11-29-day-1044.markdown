1/ **About 90 House Republicans plan to support the vote to expel George Santos from Congress** following the release of a House Ethics Committee report, which found “substantial evidence” that he knowingly filed false campaign finance statements and used campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including rent, trips, luxury items, cosmetic treatments like Botox, and a subscription to the adult-content site OnlyFans. Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, said he has “real reservations” about the motion to expel embattled the New York Republican. Santos, meanwhile, has repeatedly vowed to not resign, reiterating his belief that the bipartisan Ethics report was “littered with hyperbole and littered with biased opinions.” A vote is expected as soon as Thursday.

2/ **A grand jury indicted two Republican county supervisors in Arizona for delaying the certification of 2022 election results**. The state attorney general charged Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd with two felonies for conspiring to delay the certification of election results and interfering with the secretary of state’s statewide canvas. Both are Class 5 felonies, and each crime carries a maximum punishment of 2.5 years in prison and a $150,000 fine. "The repeated attempts to undermine our democracy are unacceptable," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said. "I took an oath to uphold the rule of law, and my office will continue to enforce Arizona's elections laws and support our election officials as they carry out the duties and responsibilities of their offices."

* **Trump embraces the Jan. 6 rioters on the trail. In court, his lawyers hope to distance him from them**. "While Trump’s glorification of Jan. 6 defendants may boost him politically as he vies to retake the White House in 2024, his lawyers’ approach lays bare a concern that arguments linking him to the rioters could harm him in front of a jury."

3/ **Trump doubled down on his calls to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act if he’s elected president again**. Without offering any details about what his alternative health care plan might be, Trump promised “much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people,” adding: "Obamacare Sucks!!!" Republicans in Congress, however, have abandoned plans to repeal the ACA since failing to undo the health care law in 2017. Trump's comments have also caught lawmakers off guard because there’s no consensus within the Republican Party on how to replace it.

4/ **Biden criticized Lauren Boebert in her own district as “one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement.”** Following a tour of a wind tower manufacturer in Pueblo, Colo., Biden mocked Boebert for voting against the Inflation Reduction Act, saying: “She along with every single Republican colleague voted against the law that made these investments and jobs possible, and that’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact." Boebert has repeatedly claimed the Inflation Reduction Act is “dangerous for America” and that Biden's climate policies are “a massive failure.” CS Wind, however, is currently undergoing a $200 million expansion that is expected to create 850 jobs by 2026 with help from the tax benefits in Biden’s inflation reduction law. The factory is the largest of its kind in the world. “Did you all know that you’re part of a massive failure?” Biden said to the workers and local officials at CS Wind. “None of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?” Biden added: “It all sounds like a massive failure in thinking by the congresswoman and her colleagues.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-promote-economic-agenda-lauren-boeberts-district-rcna127088) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/29/biden-boebert-colorado/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-boebert-colorado-republicans-0edd0c6f25fe17edd92f8c80b0488f89))

5/ **A co-founder of Students for Trump was arrested and charged with assault**. Ryan Fournier is accused of grabbing his girlfriend's arm and "striking her in the forehead with a firearm." He faces two misdemeanor charges: assault on a female and assault with a deadly weapon.
