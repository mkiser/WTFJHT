1/ **Trump won New Hampshire’s primary**, defeating Nikki Haley and advancing closer to the Republican nomination. It was the first time a non-incumbent Republican candidate in the modern era won both the Iowa and New Hampshire Republican contests. Trump, however, used his victory speech to attack Haley after she refused to drop out of the race, calling her "DELUSIONAL!!!," and an "imposter" who "had a very bad night." He added: "I don't get too angry. I get even." Nevertheless, Haley vowed to continue her campaign and challenged Trump to debate her. “I have news for all of them. New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last,” Haley said. “This race is far from over."

* **Why the Supreme Court could matter more than Iowa and New Hampshire**. "Even as Trump rumbles to the nomination, his eligibility to run for president still has not been settled." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/24/trump-nomination-supreme-court-14th-amendment-00137484))
* **Most N.H. GOP primary voters say Trump fit for presidency even if convicted**. "About half of those who voted in the New Hampshire Republican primary Tuesday believed the false claim that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 presidential election, according to preliminary exit polls, underscoring the persistence of Trump’s false claims within the GOP that the election was stolen from him." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-voters-trump-trials-2020-election/))
* **Majority of GOP primary voters aren’t MAGA, but most would be satisfied with Trump nomination**. "About two-thirds of New Hampshire GOP primary voters described themselves as conservative, according to the early results of the exit poll, with about one-quarter calling themselves very conservative. Most said they did not consider themselves a part of the MAGA movement, referring to the 'Make America Great Again' slogan popularized by Trump in 2016."

2/ **The United Auto Workers endorsed Biden for president**. “This election is about who will stand up with us and who will stand in our way,” UAW President Shawn Fain said. “Our endorsement must be earned and Joe Biden has earned it.” Fain called Trump "a scab," who "stands against everything we stand for as a union – as a society.” The UAW represents around 400,000 members.

3/ **A record 21.3 million Americans signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces**. A record 5 million more people signed up for ACA policies for 2024 compared to 2023 – the third straight year of record enrollment. The 30% annual increase in ACA sign-ups come as Trump's once again promised to repeal the program, saying it “sucks." Enrollment figures, however, indicate that Republican-leaning states would be most affected if the law were repealed. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/01/24/obamacare-record-enrollment-biden/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/obamacare-enrollment-record) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/24/obamacare-aca-health-insurance-republican-states) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/4426408-obamacare-marks-record-enrollment-5-million/))

4/ **The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court preserve full access to a widely used abortion pill**, warning that a lower-court ruling restricting its availability would have "disruptive consequences" for women and “threatens profound harms” nationwide. The Supreme Court has [agreed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/12/13/day-1058/#2-the-supreme-court-will-decide-whet) to review the lower court’s ruling, which would cut off mail-order prescriptions of mifepristone and require in-person doctor visits. “The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation. For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies,” the Justice Department said. Central to the issue is the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, which was first approved in 2000, and later approved for wider access through telemedicine, mail delivery, and prescribing by pharmacists in 2016.

5/ **More than 64,500 pregnancies have resulted from rape in the 14 states that banned abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned**, according to research by JAMA Internal Medicine. The majority of states with total bans on abortion don’t have exceptions for rape. And those that do have exceptions require victims to report the rape to authorities, something that only happens in a small fraction of sexual assaults.
