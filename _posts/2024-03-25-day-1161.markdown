1/ **The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during the month of Ramadan and the release of all hostages**. The U.S., however, abstained, which allowed the resolution to pass 14-0. This is the first ceasefire resolution to pass after four previous failures: The U.S. has vetoed three previous resolutions since the conflict began, while Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution last week. After the resolution passed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the U.S. of “retreating” from a “principled position” and that the U.S. abstention “harms the war effort as well as the effort to liberate the hostages.” Netanyahu then canceled a diplomatic visit to Washington, which Biden had requested to discuss Netanyahu’s planned ground invasion of Rafah. The U.S. had intended to use the meeting to offer alternatives to reduce civilian casualties. The State Department called the decision “a bit surprising and unfortunate.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/25/1240669997/united-nations-security-council-cease-fire-resolution-gaza-israel-war) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/25/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hostage-talks-stall-as-israeli-defense-minister-arrives-in-washington-ea36821d?mod=hp_lead_pos3) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna144870) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/middleeast/un-security-council-gaza-israel-ceasefire-intl/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/us-un-resolution-cease-fire-row-with-israel-00148813) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/25/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-25/un-security-council-demands-gaza-cease-fire-as-the-us-abstains?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-ceasefire-resolution-vote-ramadan-b7985fede65e5477aba2c8d2e62a6632) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/25/gaza-ceasefire-resolution-un-security-council-veto))

2/ **Trump’s hush money trial – his first of four criminal trials – will start April 15 in Manhattan**. Trump’s lawyers had argued that a late release of more than 100,000 pages of potential evidence should postpone the trial. Prosecutors argued that only about 300 documents were pertinent to the trial, and that “99 percent” were irrelevant. At the hearing, Judge Juan Merchan refused to allow further delays, saying that despite Trump’s claims, the district attorney’s office “is not at fault for the late production of documents from the U.S. attorney’s office” and that Trump “has been given a reasonable amount of time." Assuming the date holds, Trump will become the first former American president to face a trial on criminal charges.

3/ **Trump only needs to post a bond of $175 million – not the original $454 million – while he appeals the verdict in his civil fraud case**, a New York appeals court ruled. Trump now has 10 additional days to post the bond. The ruling comes on the last day of a 30-day grace period before New York Attorney General Letitia James could begin to collect on the judgment. Prior to the ruling, more than 30 bond companies had turned down Trump’s requests to guarantee the $454 million bond. The $175 million bond will be in place until at least September, meaning James won’t be able to seek to enforce the judgment until then, which could involve seizing Trump’s assets.

4/ **House Republicans are down to a one-vote majority** after Rep. Mike Gallagher announced he’ll resign from Congress April 19. Wisconsin law requires Gallagher’s seat to remain empty for the rest of his term. After his departure, Republicans will control 217 House seats to the Democrats’ 213.

5/ **Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed a $1.2 trillion government funding deal with mostly Democratic votes**. In October, a contingent of hard-right conservatives ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy – a first in U.S. history – for working with Democrats to avoid a shutdown. Under current House rules, it takes one lawmaker to bring up a vote to oust the speaker, but a majority of the House for that vote to pass. “This is a betrayal of the American people. This is a betrayal of Republican voters,” Greene said. “The clock has started. It’s time for our conference to pick a new speaker.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/22/1240186860/marjorie-taylor-greene-mike-johnson-motion-to-vacate-house-speaker) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/congress-motion-to-vacate-speaker-mike-johnson-marjorie-taylor-greene-9d5188eea71d3924b782c4d89cfc21a9) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/us/politics/speaker-mike-johnson-ukraine.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-files-motion-oust-mike-johnson-house-speake-rcna134385) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/03/22/congress/greene-drops-the-motion-vacate-johnson-00148543))

6/ **The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week on whether to roll back the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone** – less than two years after overturning the constitutional right to an abortion. The FDA first approved mifepristone nearly 25 years ago and multiple studies have shown it to be safe. It’s used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions nationally, and at least 5.9 million women have used mifepristone since its approval in 2000. It’s also regularly prescribed for miscarriage treatment. Nevertheless, a conservative Christian anti-abortion group sued in November 2022, arguing that the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved mifepristone in 2000 and that it overstepped again in 2016 and 2021 when it made the pill easier to obtain, including through mail-order pharmacies. The court will also hear a second case next month, concerning whether to allow state bans on abortion even when an emergency room doctor believes ending a pregnancy would preserve the mother’s health. Federal emergency-care law that requires hospitals receiving Medicare dollars to provide “necessary stabilizing treatment” to patients. Decisions in both cases are expected by the end of June or in early July.
