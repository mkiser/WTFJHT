1/ **Speaker Mike Johnson defied threats from his Republican colleagues to oust him and scheduled a vote on individual bills to fund Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan**. Johnson plans to have the House vote on three individual foreign aid bills, a fourth bill sanctioning Russia, China, and Iran, and a fifth bill addressing border security measures. The package largely mirrors the Senate-passed $95 billion aid package, with the exception for the border security provisions. Johnson, however, will almost certainly need Democratic votes to get the package to the floor, as well as to save his job if he faces a motion to vacate. Biden endorsed the plan and urged Congress to work quickly. The House is expected to vote Saturday evening.

2/ **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would “do everything necessary to defend itself.”** Over the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 attack drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on Iran’s embassy in Syria that killed two Iranian generals. The U.S., U.K., and Germany have pressed Israel to not further escalate tensions with Iran and to instead be satisfied with its successful air defense that intercepted nearly all the missiles and drones. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, however, said it’s “clear the Israelis are making a decision to act — we hope they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible.” The U.S. and the E.U are also planning new sanctions on Iran meant to “degrade Iran’s military capacity.” Nevertheless, Netanyahu said Israel “will make our own decisions” about how to respond to Iran’s retaliatory strikes. Iran, meanwhile, warned that even the “tiniest invasion” by Israel would bring a “massive and harsh” response.

3/ **For the second time in two weeks, Arizona House Republicans blocked an attempt to repeal the state’s 160-year-old near total ban on abortion**, which was [reinstated](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/04/09/day-1176/#1-arizona%E2%80%99s-supreme-court-upheld-a-1) last week by the state Supreme Court. Despite pressure from Republican candidates facing competitive races in the state, including Trump and Kari Lake, the GOP-controlled legislature blocked the Democratic-led effort to repeal the abortion ban. Arizona Republicans hold a two-seat majority in both legislative chambers. Abortion rights advocates, meanwhile, say they’ve gathered enough signatures to put a proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would create a “fundamental right” to receive abortion care up until fetal viability, or about the 24th week of pregnancy.

4/ **The Senate dismissed the impeachment case against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas**. The Democratic-controlled Senate deemed both impeachment articles unconstitutional because they didn’t rise to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The trial was then adjourned without any votes to convict or acquit. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February on their [second try by a single vote](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/02/14/day-1121/#2-house-republicans-voted-to-impeach) over his handling of the southern border. He became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.
