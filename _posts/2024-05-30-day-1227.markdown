1/ **Trump, a former U.S. president and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is a convicted felon**. A jury of 12 New Yorkers found Trump guilty on all 34 felon counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records – a crime that carries a possible sentence up to four years in prison. The verdict – both unprecedented and historic – makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. Judge Juan Merchan denied Trump's motion for an acquittal and set a sentencing hearing for July 11 – four days before the Republican National Convention. The Biden campaign said the verdict illustrates that "no one is above the law," but added: "There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president." Trump, meanwhile, declared the outcome a "disgrace," proclaimed "we didn't do a thing wrong. I’m a very innocent man," falsely claimed that the case was “done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent,” and promised that the "real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people." He added: "Our country has gone to hell, we don't have the same country anymore." Trump is expected to appeal the verdict, which could take months or years to resolve.

2/ **Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russia with U.S.-made weapons**. The approval – a significant reversal for Biden – is intended for Ukraine to strike military targets in Russia that are being used to attack Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Putin, meanwhile accused NATO of “unending escalation,” and warned this could lead to “serious consequences.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/30/biden-ukraine-weapons-strike-russia-00160731) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/30/nato-europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-weapons.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/biden-allows-ukraine-to-hit-some-russia-targets-with-us-weapons?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/biden-ukraine-limited-strikes-russia/index.html))

3/ **Chief Justice John Roberts refused to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss “the Supreme Court’s ethics crisis” related to Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas**. Alito has faced scrutiny over reports that two of his properties [displayed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/23/day-1220/#2-a-second-flag-carried-by-rioters-o) [flags](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/20/day-1217/#5-supreme-court-justice-samuel-alito) with links to those flown by Trump’s supporters during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, followed by his [refusal](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/29/day-1226/#1-supreme-court-justice-samuel-alito) to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the Jan. 6 insurrection. Thomas, meanwhile, [reportedly](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/04/06/day-807/#1-supreme-court-justice-clarence-tho) accepted secret luxury vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow for more than two decades without disclosing them. Thomas [also](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/04/13/day-814/#6-supreme-court-justice-clarence-tho) failed to disclose that he sold real estate to Crow. “Separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence counsel against such appearances,” Roberts said.
