1/ **The Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone**, rejecting a challenge to the FDA’s rules for prescribing and dispensing abortion pills. The court, however, took no position on the drugs safety, morality, or whether people have a right to bodily autonomy. Instead, the court said the anti-abortion group had failed to show they had been harmed and did not have legal standing to sue. "For that reason, the federal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs’ concerns about FDA’s actions,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court, even though the plaintiffs have "sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections." Kavanaugh suggested that the plaintiffs take their issues to the president, lawmakers, and regulators to make changes. Although the ruling was unanimous, Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho, each of which has a Republican attorney general, have brought their own claims and have different arguments for standing. Mifepristone was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year.

* poll/ **61% of Americans support mifepristone, which was approved by the FDA in 2000 (!), as a prescription drug**. Among Republicans, 32% are in favor of having mifepristone available as a prescription drug, while 87% of Democrats and 61% of independents support the drug’s legality.

2/ **Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic bill to protect access to in vitro fertilization.** Every though 49 Senate Republicans signed onto a letter voicing their support for IVF, the legislation failed 48-47. It needed 60 votes to advance. “Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,” Biden said after the vote. “The disregard for a woman’s right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.” [Last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/05/day-1233/#5-senate-republicans-blocked-a-democ), Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure to protect the federal right to access contraception nationwide.

3/ **The Supreme Court rejected an attempt to trademark the phrase “Trump too small”** – a double-entendre meant to insinuate that convicted felon Trump has a small penis. The case was brought by a lawyer who wanted a federal trademark to use the phrase on T-shirts and hats after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied his application because federal law disallows trademarking a living person's name without their consent. The lawyer contended that the law violated his right of free speech by treating speech about Trump differently from other speech that can be trademarked. The “Trump too small” phrase originates from the 2016 Republican presidential debates, during which Marco Rubio said Trump had “small hands,” adding: “And you know what they say about guys with small hands. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/13/supreme-court-trump-too-small/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/13/g-s1-2532/supreme-court-trump-t-shirts) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/13/supreme-court-trump-too-small-trademark-00163215) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-blocks-trump-small-trademark-gambit-rcna137779) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/13/supreme-court-rejects-trump-too-small-trademark) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-trademark.html))

4/ **Trump demanded that House Speaker Mike Johnson use the federal government to help him "overturn" a conviction by a jury of his peers in New York**. Shortly after he was convicted on 34 felony counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records, Trump called Johnson and, in between “frequent F-bombs,” implored Johnson to do something about his conviction.  “We have to overturn this," Trump said. Following the call, Johnson [called](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/03/day-1231/#house-speaker-mike-johnson-called-fo) for the Supreme Court to “step in” to overturn Trump’s guilty verdict and [floated](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/04/day-1232/#2-speaker-mike-johnson-floated-a-%E2%80%9Cth) a “three-pronged approach” to punish the Justice Department for Trump’s felony conviction.

5/ **Trump called Milwaukee — the location for the Republican National Convention — a "horrible city."** Even though Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden by about 20,000 votes in 2020, he’s repeatedly and falsely claimed he won the state and has baselessly claimed that absentee voting in the state was tainted by cheating or fraud despite two recounts – [both requested by Trump](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/11/30/day-1411/#5-two-recounts-in-wisconsin-%E2%80%93-reques) – and an international delegation monitoring the election [confirming](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/11/05/day-1386/#8-an-international-delegation-monito) that there was no evidence to support Trump’s allegations of voter fraud. Republican members of Congress from Wisconsin suggested that Trump was expressing his "concern about the election in Milwaukee” and "election integrity." One representative, however, said the whole thing never happened. Nevertheless, Trump may not be able to attend the convention, where he’ll officially be nominated as the Republican presidential nominee, due to the possibility he’ll be serving his sentence for his conviction on orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records. Trump’s sentencing is four days before the convention.
