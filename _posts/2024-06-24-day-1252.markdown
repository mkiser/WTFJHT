1/ **The Supreme Court upheld a federal law that prohibits anyone subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having a gun**. Chief Justice John Roberts said there was "no question" that the federal law banning firearms for domestic abusers is constitutional, saying it uses “common sense” and is applicable “after a judge determines that an individual poses a credible threat” of physical violence. The 8-1 decision – Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter – limits the court’s [2022 decision](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/06/23/day-520/#1-the-supreme-court-struck-down-a-ne) that vastly expanded Second Amendment rights by narrowing the ability of state and local governments to restrict guns outside the home. The decision comes a week after the court [ruled](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/17/day-1245/#3-the-supreme-court-overturned-a-fed) that a federal ban on "bump stocks," which makes semi-automatic rifles fire more rapidly, was unlawful.

* **Clarence Thomas Says Domestic Abusers Should Own Guns**. "In his dissent, Thomas wrote that stripping a domestic abuser’s right to own a gun pursuant to a protective order was a due process violation, calling it 'an automatic, uncontestable consequence of certain orders.’" ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-says-domestic-abusers-should-own-guns))

* **The Supreme Court Walks Back Clarence Thomas’ Guns Extremism**. "Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion walked back maximalist rhetoric—recklessly injected into the law by Justice Clarence Thomas—that had imperiled virtually every modern regulation limiting access to firearms." ([Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/06/supreme-court-clarence-thomas-guns-extremism-rahimi-bruen.html))

* **Justice Samuel Alito absent from Supreme Court session for second day in a row**. "Alito’s absence, for which the Supreme Court has not provided an explanation, is unusual because it’s the end of the term and the justices have issued nine opinions over the last two days." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/samuel-alito-not-present-supreme-court/))

* **Supreme Court Signals Term Ending in July as Trump Ruling Looms**. "The US Supreme Court signaled it will take the unusual step of extending its term into July as it finishes work on about a dozen cases, including Donald Trump’s bid for immunity from prosecution for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss." ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/supreme-court-signals-term-ending-in-july-as-trump-ruling-looms?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=MIBMEEoj))

2/ **Judge Aileen Cannon appeared skeptical of Trump’s arguments that Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel in the federal classified documents case**. Trump’s lawyer argued that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appointment of Smith’s as special counsel was “unconstitutional” and implied that it risked creating a "shadow government." Cannon replied: "That sounds very ominous, shadow government, but what do you really mean? Is that really a realistic risk when you have well-defined regulations?" Trump’s lawyer, however, did not directly answer Cannon’s question, but instead reiterated the claim that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional and implied that Smith had gone rogue and wasn’t reporting to anyone. Smith’s office, meanwhile, asked Cannon for a gag order to prevent Trump from making statements that pose a "significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger" to law enforcement agents. Prosecutors argued that Trump’s rhetoric had created a "combustible atmosphere" that poses an immediate risk to law enforcement. Despite highlighting two examples of threats or violence, Cannon indicated that she wasn’t inclined to put a gag order on Trump without prosecutors providing additional evidence directly connecting Trump’s words to threats from others against law enforcement. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-constitutional-hearing/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/judge-trump-classified-documents-case-hear-challenge-special-counsels-rcna158248) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-documents-case-jack-smith-special-counsel/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/21/trump-classified-documents-cannon-garland-smith-00164541) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/us/politics/trump-documents-special-counsel.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/21/trump-cannon-jack-smith-pretrial-hearing/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/blaming-trump-combustible-atmosphere-prosecutors-push-gag-order/story?id=111357634))

* **Special counsel probed Trump Mar-a-Lago trip that aides 'kept quiet' weeks before FBI search**. "The previously unreported visit, which allegedly took place July 10-12 in the summer of 2022, was raised in several interviews with witnesses, sources familiar with the matter said, as investigators sought to determine whether it was part of Trump's broader alleged effort to withhold the documents after receiving a subpoena demanding their return." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/special-counsel-probed-trump-mar-lago-trip-aides/story?id=111334156))

3/ **A Nevada judge dismissed the criminal indictments against six Republicans who falsely submitted certificates to Congress declaring Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 election**. Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that the state had filed the case in the wrong jurisdiction. “You have literally, in my opinion, a crime that has occurred in another jurisdiction,” Holthus said. “It’s so appropriately up north and so appropriately not here.” After the ruling, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said the “judge got it wrong” and that he’ll appeal to the state Supreme Court. [In December](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/12/06/day-1051/#4-a-nevada-grand-jury-charged-six-re), a grand jury indicted the six fake, pro-Trump electors in the scheme to overturn Biden’s 2020 election win in the state. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/nevada-judge-dismisses-trump-fake-electors-case-rcna158364) / [Nevada Independent](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-dismisses-nevada-fake-electors-case-over-lack-of-jurisdiction) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/nevada-republicans-fake-electors-indictment-trump-9d06ffc619314f85e0bdb321b820a557) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/06/21/nevada-trump-electors-case-dismissed/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/21/nevada-fake-trump-electors-charges-dismissed) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/21/judge-dismisses-charges-in-nevada-fake-electors-case-over-venue-question-00164513))

4/ **The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether states can restrict gender-affirming care for transgender minors**. Last year, Tennessee banned three types of medical care for minors – puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and gender-transition surgeries – and imposed civil penalties for doctors who violate the law. The Biden administration asked the court to intervene after a federal appeals court [upheld the ban](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/07/10/day-902/#federal-appeals-court-allowed-tennes). A ruling is expected in the court’s next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2025. About 25 states have enacted similar bans on transgender care for minors. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-transgender-health-tennessee-kentucky-75e3b446513f61281013a2bf86248044) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-weigh-state-restrictions-gender-affirming-care-youths-rcna142825) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-states-can-restrict-gender-affirming-care-for-minors/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/transgender-care-bans-for-minors-draw-review-by-supreme-court?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/24/scotus-trans-minors-gender-care/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/us/politics/supreme-court-transgender-care-tennessee.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-to-weigh-bans-on-transgender-medical-treatments-609c18ea) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-review-ban-gender-affirming-care-minors/story?id=111367818) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/24/supreme-court-trans-health-care-tennessee) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/24/supreme-court-transgender-youth-00164648))
