1/ **The Supreme Court accidentally posted its draft decision to temporarily allow medical emergency abortions in Idaho on its website**. The opinion, which was removed, shows that the justices voted 6-3 to reinstate a lower court order that had allowed hospitals in Idaho to perform emergency abortions to protect the health of the mother. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch voted in dissent. The court said it "inadvertently and briefly" uploaded what it described as a "document" about the case, and said a decision will be issued in “due course.” Idaho state law bans almost all abortions and imposes penalties of up to five years in prison on doctors who perform the procedure, except when necessary to save a woman’s life. The Biden administration [sued the state in 2022](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/08/02/day-560/#2-the-justice-department-sued-idaho), saying its abortion ban conflicts with the federal law.

2/ **The Supreme Court rejected a Republican challenge that claimed the Biden administration unlawfully coerced social media companies into removing content**, like misinformation about Covid-19 and election fraud. The 6-3 decision overturned an injunction that would have limited contacts between government officials and social media companies. The White House said the ruling will help the administration "continue our important work with technology companies to protect the safety and security of the American people, after years of Republican attacks on public officials who engaged in critical work to keep Americans safe."

3/ **Biden pardoned thousands of U.S. veterans convicted between the 1950s and 2013 of violating the military’s ban on gay sex**, which forced an estimated 100,000 people from the military. Biden said he was "righting an historic wrong" to pardon former service members "who were convicted simply for being themselves." The Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 explicitly criminalized consensual "sodomy," until Congress and Obama decriminalized same-sex relationships as part of the fiscal year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. "Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some of these patriotic Americans were subject to court-martial, and have carried the burden of this great injustice for decades," Biden said.

4/ **Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republican leaders voted to file a legal brief in support of Steve Bannon’s appeal of his conviction for defying a congressional subpoena related to the Jan. 6 attack**. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group — a House group made up of the Speaker and the leaders and whips of the majority and minority parties in the House — voted along party lines to reject the previous Congress’ handling of the Jan. 6 committee and proceed with filing a legal brief in support of Bannon. A federal judge [ordered](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/06/day-1234/#2-a-federal-judge-ordered-steve-bann) Bannon to report to prison on July 1, to begin serving his four-month prison sentence. Bannon has asked the Supreme Court to delay his prison sentence while a lower court works out his appeal.
