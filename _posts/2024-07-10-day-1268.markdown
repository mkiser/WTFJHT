1/ **Nancy Pelosi urged Biden to make a decision about whether to stay in the presidential race, saying "time is running short."** When asked if she supported Biden continuing his reelection bid, Pelosi replied that Biden is "beloved" and "respected" and "it‚Äôs up to [him] to decide if he is going to run. We‚Äôre all encouraging him to make that decision." Hours after Pelosi‚Äôs comments, Rep. Pat Ryan said Biden should drop out ‚Äúfor the good of the country.‚Äù He‚Äôs the [11th House Democrat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/calls-for-joe-biden-drop-out-election-2024/?itid=sf_elections_elections_2024_e2024-with-integrated-luf_p001_f010) to call for Biden to drop out. Meanwhile, longtime Democratic fundraiser George Clooney wrote in a [New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html?) that Biden needs to step aside as the Democratic presidential nominee. ‚ÄúI love Joe Biden,‚Äù Clooney wrote. ‚ÄúAs a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.‚Äù But, he added, the "Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‚Äòbig F-ing deal‚Äô Biden of 2010. He wasn‚Äôt even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.‚Äù Clooney also called on Democratic party leaders "to stop telling us that 51 million people didn‚Äôt see what we just saw. We‚Äôre all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we‚Äôve opted to ignore every warning sign."

2/ **Biden pledged to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems to counter Russian attacks**. In a speech on the first day of a NATO summit in Washington, Biden called the military alliance "more powerful than ever" even as it faces a "pivotal moment" in the war between Russia and Ukraine. "Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full, collective support.‚Äù NATO countries, meanwhile, have started transferring the first of more than 60 American-made F-16s to Ukraine.

3/ **The Biden administration agreed to resume shipping 500-pound bombs to Israel after a two-month pause**. The  2,000-pound bombs, however, are still on hold. Israel, meanwhile, dropped leaflets ordering residents of Gaza City ‚Äì an estimated quarter of a million people ‚Äì to evacuate, saying ‚ÄúGaza City will remain a dangerous combat zone."

4/ **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a group of House progressives introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito** over their failure to disclose gifts they have received while serving on the court. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement that Thomas and Alito's "pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed." The effort, however, stands no chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled House.

* **Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose a yacht trip to Russia and a private helicopter flight to Putin‚Äôs hometown**. "Buried on page 14 of a letter that two Democratic senators sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday, in which they urged Garland to appoint a special counsel to probe Thomas, was an astonishing list of dozens of 'likely undisclosed gifts and income‚Äù from Crow, Crow‚Äôs affiliated companies, and 'other donors.‚Äô" ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/clarence-thomas-accepted-yacht-trip-to-russia-chopper-flight-to-putins-hometown-democrats))
