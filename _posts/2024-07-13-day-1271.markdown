*What we know about the Trump rally shooting so far:*

**The shooting at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania is being investigated as an attempted assassination**. Trump said he was shot and hit by a bullet in the “upper part of my right ear." His campaign said he’s “fine.” He added: "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin." As he was ushered away, Trump raised a fist to the crowd, mouthing: “Fight. Fight. Fight.” The Secret Service said the shooter, described as a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, fired "multiple shots" from an “elevated position” outside of the rally. The gunman and at least one audience member are dead, and two other attendees are critically injured. Biden condemned the attack, saying “There’s no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick \[...\] We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this." The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, said it’s working to identify the gunman and determine the motive. Authorities said they recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle at the scene. House Republicans also [said](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/trump-rally-shooting-oversight-comer-secret-service) they will "conduct a full investigation" into the shooting. Trump’s campaign said he still plans to attend the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to begin in Milwaukee on Monday. There have been [327 mass shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2024#List) in the U.S. in 2024 so far.

"A nation barely removed from the violent end to the 2020 election, which included several deaths tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, has since been whipsawed by a cascade of jolts to the system. A House speaker ousted. A former president, Trump, indicted on criminal charges four times, only to win his party’s nod to reclaim the White House. A presidential debate only two weeks ago that found the commander in chief, Joe Biden, significantly compromised in his ability to express thoughts and recall words. Now, America is faced with the realization that political violence has struck at a moment when the nation is on the cusp of deciding its next president."
