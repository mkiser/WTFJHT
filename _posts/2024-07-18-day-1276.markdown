1/ **Obama privately told allies that Biden needs to seriously reconsider his candidacy** because his path to victory has been greatly diminished since the debate. Obama said he’s concerned that the polls and donors are moving away from Biden, while Trump’s electoral path is expanding. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/obama-says-biden-must-consider-viability/))

2/ **Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi each told Biden separately that he should reconsider his reelection bid** – or else risk losing and dragging the rest of the Democrats down with him. Schumer was reportedly "blunt" and “pretty harsh,” saying it would be better for the country and the Democratic Party if he ended his reelection campaign. Jeffries offered a similar message, saying Biden could put Democratic chances in the House at risk if he remained in the race. Pelosi, meanwhile, told Biden the polling data shows he can’t defeat Trump and that he’ll destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November if he continues his campaign. Biden said he’d seen polling that showed otherwise. Much of the recent public polling shows that Biden narrowly trails Trump nationally, though much of the data remains within the margin of error, suggesting the race is a toss-up. When asked about the conversations, the White House responded: "President Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win, and looks forward to working with congressional Democrats to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families."

3/ **Biden is reportedly "more receptive" and "willing to listen" to arguments about why he should step aside** after a number of Democrats have pressed him to reconsider his presidential bid. One Democratic adviser [said](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/trump-biden-analysis-2024/index.html) Biden has gone from saying “Kamala can’t win,” to asking “Do you think Kamala can win?” Although Biden hasn’t given any indication that he’s changing his mind about staying in the race, several top Democrats privately said they now believe Biden will drop out – possibly as soon as this weekend. “We’re close to the end,” one person close to Biden said. Another added that “reality is setting in” and it [wouldn’t be a surprise](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-election-drop-out.html) if  Biden made an announcement and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement.

4/ **Biden tested positive for Covid-19** and is isolating at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware. Biden was tested after he experienced upper respiratory symptoms and "general malaise." He received a dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, doesn't have a fever, and his symptoms remain mild. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, attempted to fundraise off the 81-year-old testing positive Covid-19, tweeting: "I'm sick." Two minutes later, it followed up with "of Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here," with a link to donate.
