1/ **Harris applauded Biden and his "legacy of accomplishment over the past three years" in her first public remarks since he dropped out and endorsed her for president**. Harris, who has emerged as the party favorite to replace him at the top of the ticket, called Biden’s term "unmatched in modern history" and  praised his “deep love of our country." As expected, Harris did not directly address her presidential campaign, but the Biden-Harris campaign formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare her a candidate for president. Harris is expected to assume control of the Biden-Harris campaign account, which had nearly $96 million cash in hand at the end of June. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-praises-biden-first-public-event-endorsed-president-rcna163050) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/fec-biden-harris-campaign-account/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/biden-drops-out-updates/?id=112113289))

2/ **Nancy Pelosi endorsed Harris to replace Biden as the nominee for president**, urging her colleagues to “unify and charge forward to resoundingly defeat Donald Trump.” Pelosi said she offered her endorsement "with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future," adding that her "enthusiastic support \[...\] is official, personal and political." Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, however, stopped short of endorsing Harris. Instead the two said she is “off to a great start” and that they’re planning to meet with her in person “in short order.” The two added that Harris’s candidacy has “excited the country.” All 23 Democratic governors have now endorsed Harris, including would-be challengers Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, JB Pritzker, Andy Beshear, Wes Moore, Tim Walz, and Tony Evers – eliminating speculation that they might try to challenge her at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in four weeks.  Harris has also [secured](https://apnews.com/article/harris-biden-presidential-candidate-election-withdraw-9fbd153493cb3f088994854fe61a73e9) the backing of more than half of the Democratic delegates she needs to become her party’s nominee. In total, it took less than 24 hours for Harris to all but clear the Democratic presidential field since Biden [ended his presidential re-election campaign](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/21/day-1279/#1-following-intense-pressure-from-ne). The Harris campaign, meanwhile, said it raised a record-breaking $81 million in its first 24 hours – more than double the $39.6 million she raised during the entirety of her 2020 presidential bid. In [total](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/22/live-updates-harris-democrats-biden-drops-out-trump-campaign.html), Harris and the Democratic party have received roughly $250 million in donations and major donor commitments since Biden dropped out.

* **Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will be the co-chair of Harris’ presidential campaign, but ruled out accepting a nomination for vice president**. “I am not leaving Michigan,” she said. “I am proud to be the governor of Michigan; I have been consistent.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-campaign-biden-drop-out/gretchen-whitmer-vice-president-00170328) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/2024-election-biden-kamala-harris-campaign-updates/#link-IMNSSOGYWVERXJLLYJISLCQHZY) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-22/kamala-harris-likely-to-pick-from-rising-stars-for-running-mate) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-vp-list.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/g-s1-12690/democrats-rally-behind-vice-president-harris))

* **📈 If Harris Is the Nominee, It Still Won’t Be Easy to Beat Trump**. "Ever since Donald J. Trump won the presidency, Democrats have stuck to a winning electoral playbook: From congressional races to presidential ones, they’ve nominated well-liked, moderate candidates who could appeal to nearly any voter who disliked Mr. Trump and his allies." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/upshot/kamala-harris-polls-trump.html))

3/ **Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee called for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign** after she refused to answer specific questions about the security failures that led to the [assassination attempt on Trump](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/15/day-1273/). Cheatle, however, did call the shooting the agency’s “most significant operational failure” in decades, and vowed to “move heaven and earth” to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there’s no repeat of it. Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting, and confirmed that the roof had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.
