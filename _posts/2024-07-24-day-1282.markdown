1/ **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel’s war in Gaza and condemned American protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” in his speech to a joint session of Congress**. Netanyahu portrayed the war in Gaza as a “clash between barbarism and civilization” and declared “we will win,” saying: “Our enemies are your enemies. Our fight is your fight. And our victory will be your victory.” Since the Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage, Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed an estimated 39,090 Palestinians and injured another 90,147. Nearly all 2.3 million Gazans have been internally displaced. More than 50 congressional Democrats declined to attend the speech in protest of Netanyahu’s handling of the war. Republicans, [meanwhile](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/24/congress/republicans-blast-harris-for-skipping-bibi-00170886), criticized Harris’s decision not to attend and preside over the joint session of Congress in her role as president of the Senate. Although she was attending a previously scheduled gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis, Republicans nevertheless called it a "disgrace" and accused her of putting politics above the Israel-U.S. relationship. Republicans, however, did not attack JD Vance, who also had a prior commitment and did not attend.

2/ **Democrats adopted rules to choose their presidential nominee via a virtual roll call vote**. Voting to officially nominate Kamala Harris, who has already amassed enough pledged support from delegates to win, will begin online on Aug. 1. At least 3,180 of the nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates have already endorsed Harris. The party wants to officially nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by Aug. 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans, meanwhile, warned members to stop making overtly racist and sexist attacks against Harris. When nominated, Harris will be the first Black and South Asian woman to be a major party nominee. The warning follows a series of comments by Republicans that focused on Harris’ race as well as accusations that she is a "DEI hire” – a reference to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

3/ **The Trump campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing that the Harris campaign can’t take over the Biden campaign's $91.5 million dollars**. Even though the funds raised were authorized for both Biden and Harris and share the same entity as their joint campaign depository under federal election law, Trump’s campaign called it a violation of campaign finance contribution limits. The Harris campaign responded to the FEC complaint, saying: “Republicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims – like the ones they’ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections – will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election.” ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-campaign-complaint-fec-prevent-biden-funds-transfer-harris/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-fec-block-harris-accessing-bidens-campaign/story?id=112226408))

* **Elon Musk denied reports that he was donating $45 million a month to elect Trump**. Over the weekend, Trump bragged about Musk’s reported donations at a campaign rally in Michigan: “I love Elon Musk. Elon endorsed me the other day. I read — I didn’t even know this. He did not tell me about it. He gives me $45 million a month. Not $45 million — he gives me $45 million a month. I talked to him just a little while ago to say I was coming here, ‘how you doing.’ He did not even mention it.” Tesla’s second quarter profits, [meanwhile](https://www.semafor.com/article/07/24/2024/teslas-profits-dropped-for-second-time-this-year), fell 45% from last year due to weak electric vehicle sales. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/elon-musk-backs-down-from-45-million-a-month-pledge-to-trump-says-he-doesnt-subscribe-to-cult-of-personality/) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-45-million-trump-never-pledged-donate-1235066489/))

4/ **Almost 40,000 people registered to vote in the 48 hours after Biden announced he was suspending his reelection campaign and endorsing Harris**. Vote.org said 38,500 new voters registered – the largest number of registrations in a 48-hour period this election cycle and an almost 700% daily increase in new registrations. Of the new voter registrations, 83% were from people aged 18-34.

poll/ **49% of voters support Trump, compared to 46% for Harris**. The results are within the poll’s margin of error. In previous surveys, Trump lead Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/cnn-poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump/index.html))

poll/ **46% of voters said they’d support Trump if the election were held today, while 45% said they’d support Harris**, and 9% are undecided. Earlier this month, 2% said they were undecided between Trump and Biden. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/23/nx-s1-5048890/elections-poll-biden-harris-trump))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **🥥 Hillary Clinton: How Kamala Harris Can Win and Make History**. "Elections are about the future. That’s why I am excited about Vice President Kamala Harris. She represents a fresh start for American politics. She can offer a hopeful, unifying vision. She is talented, experienced and ready to be president. And I know she can defeat Donald Trump. There is now an even sharper, clearer choice in this election. On one side is a convicted criminal who cares only about himself and is trying to turn back the clock on our rights and our country. On the other is a savvy former prosecutor and successful vice president who embodies our faith that America’s best days are still ahead. It’s old grievances versus new solutions." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/opinion/kamala-harris-donald-trump.html))

2. **🤔 JD Vance Has a Bunch of Weird Views on Gender**. "The one instinct that Vance and the rest of the New Right share is a deep skepticism about modern feminism and gender equality — or what the New Right calls “gender ideology.” Overt chauvinism that seeks to roll back much of feminism’s gains is one of the most obvious unifying threads of this varied movement, and Trump’s choice of Vance anoints and entrenches it into the culture-war side of the MAGA movement." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/24/jd-vance-gender-views-00170673))
