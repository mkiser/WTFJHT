1/ **Biden called for a constitutional amendment to reform the Supreme Court**, pressing Congress to establish 18-year term limits and a binding, enforceable code of conduct for the court’s nine justices. Biden, [in an op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/), said “no one” including “a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States” is above the law. He added: "What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.” Biden also called for a constitutional amendment to limit the Supreme Court’s “dangerous and extreme” decision to grant blanket immunity to presidents for crimes they commit in office. A constitutional amendment requires two-thirds support from both chambers of Congress, or through a constitutional convention by two-thirds of the states. Ratification requires support from three-fourths of state legislatures. Speaker Mike Johnson called Biden's proposals an effort to "delegitimize the court," and said plan "is dead on arrival in the House."

2/ **Trump told Christians “you won’t have to vote anymore” if he wins in November**. "You gotta get out and vote. Just this time," Trump said at the at the Turning Point Believers’ Summit, adding: “It’ll be fixed; it’ll be fine; you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians” because “we’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.” Asked to clarify Trump’s threat to free and fair elections, a campaign spokesman said "Trump was talking about uniting this country and bringing prosperity to every American, as opposed to the divisive political environment that has sowed so much division and even resulted in an assassination attempt." Trump, however, [previously refused](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/12/06/day-1051/#1-trump-refused-to-rule-out-abusing) to rule out abusing power if re-elected and said he would not be a dictator upon returning to office “except for Day One.” Republicans, [meanwhile](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-shrug-trump-wont-have-to-vote-anymore-1235069608/), dismissed Trump’s statement as "a joke,” and just “a classic Trumpism.” Harris campaign responded to Trump’s comments, saying when Harris "says this election is about freedom she means it," adding: “Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump.” ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-vote-believers-summit/679273/?gift=mIBPPidhhodu0voIJGg1qH_-FS-Cq1IdsyHamr8U3nU) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/trump-votes-christians.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-U0.99ad.Z58CgfqpBLXD) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kamala-harris-trump-election-07-27-24?cid=ios_app#h_dd3b126ae92c9959d5e06a803f7b1ab1) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/27/trump-speech-no-need-to-vote-future) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/27/trump-faces-backlash-four-years-you-dont-have-vote-again-remark/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-camp-responds-trump-telling-christians-dont-vote/story?id=112338473) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/28/trump-christians-voting-turning-point-speech) / [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/trump-tells-christian-supporters-you-wont-have-to-vote-anymore/) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/terrifying-trump-vows-christians-will-never-have-to-vote-again) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-trump-wont-have-to-vote-again-comments_n_66a65e91e4b0c2bbb131482b) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054272/trump-christian-wont-vote-anymore-speech) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-christian-voters-turning-point-action/))

3/ **Trump promised to "fire" the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler “on day one”** and make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world” by picking crypto-friendly regulators if he returns to the White House. Trump also proposed a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile" and a policy to keep 100% of the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds  (about 210,000 bitcoins). “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA,” Trump said. “If Bitcoin is going to the moon, as they say, ‘it’s going to the moon,’ I want America to be the nation that leads the way.” Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell more than 1% Monday.
