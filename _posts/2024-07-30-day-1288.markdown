1/ **Trump repeated his assertion that if Christians "vote for me, you’re not going to have to do it ever again – it’s true."** When Fox News’s Laura Ingraham offered Trump an out – saying “You mean you don’t have to vote for you, because you’ll have four years in office” – Trump cut her off and said: “Don’t worry about the future. You have to vote on Nov. 5. After that, you don’t have to worry about voting anymore. I don’t care, because we’re going to fix it. The country will be fixed and we won’t even need your vote anymore, because frankly we will have such love, if you don’t want to vote anymore, that’s OK.” Meanwhile, Trump suggested that he would “probably end up debating” Kamala Harris but that he “could also make a case for not doing it.” His comments come after his campaign said it wouldn’t commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee, prompting Harris to accuse Trump of “backpedaling” on a debate.

2/ **Trump attempted to clean up JD Vance’s past comments that Democrats, like Kamala Harris, are “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable,” saying Vance "likes family \[...\] a lot of people like family."** Trump added there isn’t “anything wrong in saying that,” but also said that he thinks not having children is “just as good” as having a family. In a 2021 Fox News interview, Vance complained how “the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.” And those – Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – without biological children “don’t really have a direct stake” in the country’s future. And in 2020, Vance [said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-100-days?id=112358511&entryId=112401300) those without kids were "more sociopathic" than those with kids and made the country "less mentally stable." Vance, when given an opportunity to address the comments, said he didn’t mean to criticize “people who, for various reasons, didn’t have kids,” but added: “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats."

3/ **JD Vance confirmed that his feelings are not hurt by Democrats calling him “weird” for his remarks that the country was run by “childless cat ladies,”** calling it "the price of admission \[...\] I think it’s an honor." [Over the weekend](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/28/us/harris-trump-election), Kamala Harris said Trump’s and Vance’s “wild lies about my record \[...\] is just plain weird.” [And](https://www.salon.com/2024/07/29/old-and-quite-weird-democrats-finally-discover-new-effective--and-hate-it/), in a press release titled “Statement on a 78-Year-Old Criminal’s Fox News Appearance,” the Harris campaign noted that Trump had "Praised dictators because he wants to be one; Trump is clearly worried he made the wrong pick in JD Vance; Trump is old and quite weird?" The line of attack is credited to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who first said "these guys are just weird" in response to Trump’s [repeated praise](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-hannibal-lecter-rant-origin.html) of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter and how – [hypothetically](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/26/trump-shark-ev-boat-electrocution/) – he’d prefer electrocution to a shark encounter if his electric boat sank. Meanwhile, failed Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said “this whole ‘they’re weird’ argument from the Democrats is dumb & juvenile,” to which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [responded](https://newrepublic.com/post/184355/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-republican-reaction-kamala-harris-weird-trump-attack): “It’s an incel platform, dude. It’s SUPER weird. And people need to know.” [Elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/jd-vance-kamala-harris-campaign/), Vance characterized the emergence of Harris’s campaign as a “political sucker punch." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/tim-walz-minnesota-kamala-harris.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4797969-jd-vance-weird-insult-democrats/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-trump-vance-weird-c54d506d1f533ee7aa455f7b500322c5) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/laugh-harris-trump-what-matters/index.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-calling-donald-trump-weird-trend-minnesota-governor-tim-walz/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/29/trump-weird-political-insult-democrats/74585463007/))

4/ **Lara Trump, the Republican Party co-chair and Trump’s daughter-in-law, compared Harris to a designer handbag made to look like a “trash bag.”** The comment echos Trump’s insult last week that Harris is “real garbage.” Despite Harris [raising more than $200 million in her first week](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/kamala-harris-fundraising-00171630), [erasing](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/harris-erases-trumps-lead-wsj-poll-finds-e286144d) Trump’s lead in the polls  and [touting](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-sees-boost-favorability-after-biden-drops-race/story?id=112306763) a higher favorability rating, Lara Trump nevertheless said, “It’s been incredible to see the way they have tried to prop up Kamala Harris and really sell her as some sort of, this amazing political figure to the American people." She added: “It reminds me of, there was a bag that a very famous designer designed. This was several years ago, and it literally was a trash bag, but they sold this thing for like $2,000 thinking that people will actually buy it."
