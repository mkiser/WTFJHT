1/ **Trump questioned Kamala Harris’ racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference**, falsely suggesting that Harris had misled voters about her race. Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – both immigrants to the U.S. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," Trump said. "So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Later, Trump said “she was Indian all the way,” but then “became a Black person \[...\] I think somebody should look into that too.” Trump also frequently mispronounced Harris’s first name. In addition, Trump berated the Black reporter who asked him about his past racist rhetoric, including his insults toward Black prosecutors, repeated false claims that Obama was born in Africa, and his racist calls for four congresswomen to [“go back”](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/07/18/day-910/#2-trump-continued-his-racist-call-fo) to where they came from. “Well first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said, calling the interview “disgraceful” and criticizing what he characterized as a “rude introduction.” The Harris campaign, meanwhile, said: "The hostility Donald Trump showed on stage today is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president. \[...\] Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency. \[...\] Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us. \[...\] Today's tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump's MAGA rallies this entire campaign." And, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre added that Trump’s comments were “repulsive,” “insulting,” and “no one has any right to tell someone who they are.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-black-voters-nabj-harris/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/31/us/harris-trump-election) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-31/trump-questions-harris--embrace-of-black-identity-at-nabj-event) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sitdown-black-journalists-convention-sparks-backlash-2024-07-31/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-journalists-convention-nabj-1e96aa530e88013ed6f577feaf89ccb6) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/31/donald-trump-nabj-interview-00172104) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/trump-attacks-harriss-identity-saying-he-didnt-know-she-was-black-79fa5cb3) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/trump-black-journalist-convention-nabj.html))

2/ **Kamala Harris dared Trump to "say it to my face" and commit to a presidential debate**. “Well Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider, to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said. “Because as the saying goes, ‘If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.’” Trump has wavered on whether he will participate in a Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News. While he had agreed to the debate when Biden was the likely nominee, Trump’s since backtracked, saying he “probably” will debate her, but he “can also make a case for not doing it.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-trump.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/harris-atlanta-rally-rsvp-megan-thee-stallion.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/harris-georgia-trump-rally-atlanta-4454ff5825d8f6cf90929147f5b84a71) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-harris-presidential-election-live-updates-rcna164122))

3/ **The Trump campaign forced the architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 to resign**. The move comes after public criticism from Democrats, as well as Trump, over the conservative manifesto to radically reshape the federal government in a second Trump administration. Trump’s campaign manager reportedly “put the screws” to Paul Dans in an effort to force him out and shut down the Heritage Foundation’s work on the playbook. Dans’ departure, however, doesn’t mean the project is shutting down. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, said “Our collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels – federal, state, and local – will continue.” Trump had repeatedly disavowed the program created by many of his allies and former aides to overhaul of the federal government by replacing many civil service workers with loyalists and implementing socially conservative policies. JD Vance also wrote the foreword in an upcoming book about Project 2025 written by Roberts. Nevertheless, the Trump team said "Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you."

4/ **The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but suggested a rate cut could come as soon as September**. “The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. “If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.” Powell’s comments followed a Federal Open Market Committee decision to leave the federal funds rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. That rate – the highest in 23 years – has been in place for the past year following 11 increases aimed at bringing down inflation that surged to a four-decade high in 2022.
