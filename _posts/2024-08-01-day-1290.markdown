1/ **Russia freed wrongly convicted journalist Evan Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan as part of the largest prisoner swap since the Cold War**. In total, four Americans, seven Russian political prisoners, and five Germans were released from Russia in exchange for eight Russians who had been imprisoned in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Slovenia, and Poland. The most notable prisoner released in the swap is Vadim Krasikov, a convicted Russian assassin who received a life sentence for the 2019 murder of a former Chechen separatist fighter in Germany. Biden called the swap “a feat of diplomacy,” and "a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world whom you can trust and depend on.” After the prisoner exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkey, Biden said: "And now their brutal ordeal is over and they're free." Later, when [asked](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-celebrates-freeing-americans-wrongfully-detained-russia-agony/story?id=112475052) about Trump's repeated claims he could've gotten the hostages out of Russia without concessions, Biden replied: "Why didn't he do it when he was president?"

2/ **Kamala Harris dismissed Trump’s accusation that she "turned Black" for political gain, saying his remarks are the “same old show” of “divisiveness and disrespect.”** Harris added: “The American people deserve better. The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us — they are an essential source of our strength.” Mark Kelly, a contender to be Harris’ running mate, called Trump’s remarks “the comments of a desperate, scared old man” who has “been having his butt kicked by an experienced prosecutor. I think he’s worried, and she’s going to continue to do this, and she’s going to win the election in November.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/31/harris-trump-race-attacks-00172208) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/31/nx-s1-5059091/donald-trump-nabj-interview) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-focuses-harris-race-black-jobs-combative-panel-black-journalists-rcna164271) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/harris-black-identity-trump/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/01/us/trump-harris-election-news) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/01/trump-harris-nabj-black-voters-disrespect))

* **📌 [Day 1289](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/31/day-1289/#1-trump-questioned-kamala-harris%E2%80%99-ra): Trump questioned Kamala Harris’ racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference**, falsely suggesting that Harris had misled voters about her race. Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – both immigrants to the U.S. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," Trump said. "So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Later, Trump said “she was Indian all the way,” but then “became a Black person \[...\] I think somebody should look into that too.” Trump also frequently mispronounced Harris’s first name. In addition, Trump berated the Black reporter who asked him about his past racist rhetoric, including his insults toward Black prosecutors, repeated false claims that Obama was born in Africa, and his racist calls for four congresswomen to [“go back”](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2019/07/18/day-910/#2-trump-continued-his-racist-call-fo) to where they came from. “Well first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said, calling the interview “disgraceful” and criticizing what he characterized as a “rude introduction.” The Harris campaign, meanwhile, said: "The hostility Donald Trump showed on stage today is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president. \[...\] Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency. \[...\] Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us. \[...\] Today's tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump's MAGA rallies this entire campaign." And, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre added that Trump’s comments were “repulsive,” “insulting,” and “no one has any right to tell someone who they are.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-black-voters-nabj-harris/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/31/us/harris-trump-election) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-31/trump-questions-harris--embrace-of-black-identity-at-nabj-event) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sitdown-black-journalists-convention-sparks-backlash-2024-07-31/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-journalists-convention-nabj-1e96aa530e88013ed6f577feaf89ccb6) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/31/donald-trump-nabj-interview-00172104) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/trump-attacks-harriss-identity-saying-he-didnt-know-she-was-black-79fa5cb3) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/trump-black-journalist-convention-nabj.html))

3/ **JD Vance insists he has a “good relationship” with Trump**, "and that will keep on going through all the way to November, hopefully past that too." Hours earlier, however, Trump suggested that Vance, who is polling as [the worst vice presidential candidate](https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-lowest-vice-president-approval-rating-republican-convention-2024-7) in decades, doesn’t matter because vice presidents have "virtually no impact." Nevertheless, after spending days defending himself against his own past remarks that Democrats are “childless cat ladies living miserable lives,” Vance said: “Look, it’s the same thing they did to Dick Cheney, the same thing they did to Mike Pence. I think that any Republican who comes out of the gate as the new VP nominee is gonna get attacked. I have no doubt that the president is confident in the way that I’ve been doing things.” ([NOTUS](https://www.notus.org/trump-2024/jd-vance-interview-trump) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/01/2024-election-campaign-updates-harris-trump/#link-SK2KHDWXMVAMHJM3ZUJOV56FGE) / [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-vp-pick-no-impact-jd-vance-political-experts-disagree-2024-8) / [New York Magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-long-will-donald-trump-and-j-d-vance-be-friends.html))

4/ **A New York appeals court rejected Trump’s attempt to lift the gag order against him in his criminal case**. Trump argued that the gag order was unnecessary and should be dismissed after his [conviction](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t) in May on 34 counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records. Trump also argued that the order was "unjust and unconstitutional" because it restricts his ability to respond to Kamala Harris, who has framed her candidacy as a choice between a prosecutor and a “convicted felon.” The five-judge panel, however, agreed with Judge Juan Merchan that the order should remain in place until sentencing, writing that "the fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing."

5/ **Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan bill to expand the child tax credit for millions of families and extend some corporate tax breaks**. The bipartisan tax bill passed the House six months ago, but fell short of the 60-vote threshold required to defeat a filibuster, on a 48 to 44 vote.
