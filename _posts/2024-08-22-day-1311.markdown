1/ **Tim Walz formally accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president and thanked the party for “bringing the joy to this fight.”** Walz – a teacher, coach, and veteran – introduced himself to the nation by saying: "In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. And even if we wouldn't make those same choices for ourselves, we've got a golden rule: mind your own damn business." He denounced Trump's form of leadership, saying good leaders "don't spend all day insulting people and blaming people. Leaders do the work. I don't know about you all, but I'm ready to turn the page on these guys. So go ahead, say it with me: 'We're not going back!'" As Walz delivered his speech, he gave his family a shoutout from the stage, which [prompted](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/nx-s1-5086342/gus-tim-walz-father-son-dnc) his 17-year-old son, Gus, to stand and tearfully pointed to his father: "That's my dad!" Earlier in the night, Oprah Winfrey [urged](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/dnc-oprah-speech-harris) voters to "choose common sense over nonsense" and vote for Kamala Harris, [calling](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/oprah-winfrey-kamala-harris-dnc.html) her “the best of America.” Bill Clinton, [meanwhile](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/dnc-bill-clinton-speech-harris), boasted that he's "still younger" than Trump and contrasted Trump’s self-centeredness with how "Kamala Harris is the only candidate in this race who has the vision, the experience, the temperament, the will, and yes — the sheer joy — to get something done." He added: "Now, how does Donald Trump use his voice? He mostly to talks about himself. [...] The next time you hear him, don't count the lies — count the I's." Tonight, Harris will use her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention to [propose](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/harris-dnc-acceptance-speech-preview-2024) a "New Way Forward" – her agenda that promises economic opportunity while protecting fundamental freedoms.

2/ **Trump, calling himself "the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had," referred to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as the “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and criticized him for supporting Kamala Harris**. In a late night post on his personal social media network, Trump falsely accused Harris of hoping that Israel “will fail” and claimed “Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.” Trump has also repeatedly said Jews who plan to vote for Harris “should have their head examined,” and that “if you’re Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you’re a fool.” The White House spokesperson called the comments “Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Shapiro, meanwhile, responded, saying “Donald Trump is obsessed with me and continuing to spew hate and division in our politics. He’s someone who’s routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this. It’s clear that he is going to continue to be the hateful divisive person that he’s always been in this campaign.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/08/22/dnc-live-updates-coverage/donald-trump-josh-shapiro-jewish-governor-00175805) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/trump-shapiro-jewish-governor-antisemitism.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/shapiro-trump-white-house-antisemitism))

3/ **The Supreme Court partly granted the Republican National Committee’s request to enforce an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in some cases**. The court allowed the enforcement of a provision from a 2022 state law that mandates proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections, but blocked provisions that would prevent non-citizens from voting in federal or by mail. Under the previous system, Arizona residents using either form could vote only in federal elections if they declined to submit proof of citizenship. More than 40,000 people have registered to vote in federal elections in Arizona without providing proof of citizenship. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/nx-s1-5084146/voter-registration-arizona-supreme-court-citizenship) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-partly-grants-gop-request-enforce-arizonas-proof-citizen-rcna167192) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-arizona-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/politics/supreme-court-arizona-proof-of-citizenship-law) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/22/arizona-voters-proof-citizenship-supreme-court-scotus-decision/74908206007/))

4/ **The Arkansas Supreme Court block an abortion-rights initiative from appearing on the state's ballot**. Election officials said Arkansans for Limited Government failed to comply with state law because they didn’t correctly submit a sworn statement confirming that paid canvassers had been instructed on how to collect signatures. Although the group had gathered over 100,000 signatures to place the amendment on the ballot – well over the 90,074 needed – 87,675 were collected by volunteers. The rest, about 14,000, were collected by paid canvassers. The Arkansas secretary of state's office cited a failure to follow procedures related to the use of paid canvassers to invalidate 14,000 signatures, which dropped the petition below the signature threshold needed.
