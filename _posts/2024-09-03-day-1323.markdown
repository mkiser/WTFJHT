1/ **Trump claimed that he had "every right" to interfere with the 2020 presidential election**. In a Fox News interview, Trump said: "It's so crazy that my poll numbers go up. Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election where you have every right to do it. You get indicted and your poll numbers go up." Last week, however, Trump was [indicted again](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/08/27/day-1316/#1-special-counsel-jack-smith-charged) in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, said Trump’s remarks "make it clear that he believes he is above the law."

* **Democrats grow concerned Republicans are planting seeds with legal suits to overturn a Trump defeat**. "Democrats say the lawsuits, which are varied, are part of a concerted effort to sow distrust of the results."

2/ **A federal judge rejected Trump’s attempt to move his New York criminal case into federal court**. Three months after Trump was [convicted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t) in state court on all 34 felony counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records, Trump filed a motion to move the case to federal court to indefinitely delay his sentencing scheduled for Sept. 18. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, however, ruled that Trump had not met the burden of proof required to move the case to federal court. Trump previously tried — and [failed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/judge-denies-trumps-bid-move-new-york-hush-money-case-federal-court-rcna92979) — to move the case to federal court. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-sentencing-new-york-immunity-a905207c7db9fc48d022d68ac6cc12e1) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/nyregion/trump-hush-money-case.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/new-york-prosecutors-urge-judge-reject-trump-delay-tactics-hush-money-rcna169341) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/trump-hush-money-conviction-sentencing-00176819) / [CNBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hush-money-case-federal-court-delay-sentencing-rcna168917))

3/ **Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked Trump to prove he never illegally accepted nearly $10 million from the Egyptian government**. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s top Democrat, and Rep. Robert Garcia, the minority leader of a subcommittee on national security, asked Trump to provide evidence "that you never, directly or indirectly, politically or personally, received any fund from the Egyptian president or government." The request follows [recent reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/08/02/trump-campaign-egypt-investigation/) that five days before Trump became president in January 2017, a Cairo bank manager was asked by an organization linked to the Egyptian intelligence service to “kindly withdraw” nearly $10 million from its account in cash. “Surely you would agree that the American people deserve to know whether a former president—and a current candidate for president—took an illegal campaign contribution from a brutal foreign dictator,” they wrote. Late in his 2016 campaign, Trump [wired](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/28/trump-sends-a-fresh-10-million-to-his-campaign-for-final-push.html) $10 million to his campaign. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/09/03/trump-egypt-investigation-menendez/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/trump-egypt-democrats-letter.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4860121-trump-egyptian-government-probe/))

* **📌 [Day 1364](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/10/14/day-1364/#6-federal-prosecutors-spent-more-tha): Federal prosecutors spent more than three years investigating whether an Egyptian state-owned bank backed Trump's injection of $10 million into his 2016 campaign**. The investigation, which predated and outlasted Robert Mueller's probe, examined whether it was an illegal foreign campaign contribution. Mueller litigated the case up to the Supreme Court in 2019. The justices declined to hear the case. When the special counsel's office shut down in 2019, Mueller transferred the investigation to prosecutors in Washington. The investigation remained open until current acting U.S. Attorney for D.C. Michael Sherwin formally closed the case in July.
