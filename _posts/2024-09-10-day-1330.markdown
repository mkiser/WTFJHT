1/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t have the votes to pass a spending bill to avert a government shutdown**. Although the House voted 209-206 to approve a rule to debate the funding plan, which includes the SAVE Act, which would bar noncitizens from registering to vote in federal elections, which is already illegal, at least 10 Republicans have indicated they’ll vote "no." Meaning, Johnson will need Democratic support to pass his plan to push the shutdown deadline into March through the House. Republicans control the House 221-210. The bill, however, is considered dead-on-arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate with Chuck Schumer saying they’d only take up legislation that is “free of poison pills.” The Biden administration also threatened to veto the measure. Government funding runs out on Sept. 30, but Congress is only in session through Sept. 27.

2/ **The U.S. accused Iran of sending short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine**. “We’ve warned Tehran publicly, we’ve warned Tehran privately, that taking this step would be a dangerous escalation,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “Russia has now received shipments of these missiles.” Russia is expected to use the shipments within weeks. In response, the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany announced new sanctions to inflict “significant economic consequences for Tehran’s actions,” including additional sanctions on Iran Air, the state airline.

3/ **U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for “fundamental changes” to the way Israeli forces operate in the occupied West Bank** after the Israeli military said it was “highly likely” that it killed an American woman during a protest last week. Blinken called the shooting “unprovoked and unjustified,” saying the killing of Aysenur Eygi was “not acceptable” and that “no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest.” The IDF previously said it had responded with fire toward a “main instigator” who was alleged to have been throwing rocks, but later said that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire, which was not aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator” of the protest. Blinken, however, did not address the Israeli strike on a designated humanitarian zone in Gaza, which killed at least 19 Palestinians, or offer a plan to alter U.S. weapons support for Israel.

4/ **The Biden administration condemned Tucker Carlson after he hosted a Holocaust denier on his podcast**, calling the interview “a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans.” Further, every Jewish Democrat in the House signed onto a joint statement denouncing Carlson for interviewing Darryl Cooper, a "Nazi apologist and Holocaust denier." Cooper claims that the U.S. was on the "wrong side" of World War II and contends that the Holocaust was not a deliberate genocide, but rather an unintended consequence of the Nazis' lack of resources to care for the millions they imprisoned in concentration camps, who “ended up dead.” Elon Musk, who promoted the interview on his social media platform, X, called the interview “very interesting. Worth watching.” He later deleted the post.
