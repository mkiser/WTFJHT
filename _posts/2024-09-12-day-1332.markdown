1/ **A North Dakota judge struck down the state's abortion ban**, saying the state constitution creates a “fundamental right” to access abortion before a fetus is viable and restrictions on that right is “a violation on medical freedom.” Judge Bruce Romanick ruled that the abortion ban – one of the strictest in the U.S. – was “unconstitutionally void for vagueness.” The law, enacted by the legislature last year, made the procedure illegal in all cases except rape or incest but only when the woman has been pregnant for less than six weeks, or to “prevent the death or health risk to the pregnant female.” It’s the second time in two years that Romanick has overturned the state’s ban on abortion.

2/ **An Atlanta-area judge dismissed two charges against Trump in the Georgia election subversion case**. A third charge against several of Trump's co-defendants was also dismissed in the election interference case accusing them of criminally conspiring to try to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. Trump now faces eight charges – down from 13 in the original indictment – and all the remaining defendants still stand accused of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee dismissed the three charges – filing false documents, attempting to file false documents, and criminally conspiring to file false documents – under the supremacy clause, which prohibits state prosecutions of activities that fall under federal jurisdiction.

3/ **The New York Court of Appeals rejected Trump’s efforts to overturn the gag order in his New York criminal case**, which he was convicted on 34 counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records. The court dismissed Trump’s appeal because “no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.” Trump’s gag order, which bars him from making statements outside of court about witnesses, court and Manhattan DA staffers, jurors, prosecutors, and their relatives, will be lifted after he’s sentenced Nov. 26.

4/ **Trump ruled out another debate with Kamala Harris** – two days after he [visibly struggled](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/09/11/day-1331/) and repeatedly careened between angry rants and bizarre claims about eating pets in their lone showdown. “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!,” Trump posted on his personal social media platform, falsely claiming victory in the debate he did not win. “When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, ‘I WANT A REMATCH.’” Multiple post-debate [polls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/11/kamala-harris-debate-performance-polls/), however, reliably show that audiences believe Harris won.
