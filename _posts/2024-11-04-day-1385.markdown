todayInOneSentence: Trump, who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss, said he “shouldn’t
  have left” the White House; Trump suggested that Liz Cheney should have guns “trained
  on her face," wondering how his prominent Republican critic would fare “with a rifle
  standing there with nine barrels shooting at her”; Trump said he wouldn't "mind"
  if someone had to "shoot through the fake news" to get to him; Trump didn’t rule
  out banning vaccines if he becomes president and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan
  to remove fluoride from public water "sounds OK to me"; House Speaker Mike Johnson
  said Republicans “probably will” try to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act if they
  control Congress and Trump wins the White House; and at a rally hours before the
  election, the Republican Party’s presidential candidate used a microphone holder
  on his podium to pantomime the act of giving fellatio.

1/ **Trump, who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss, said he “shouldn’t have left” the White House**. “We did so well,” he added, “so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.” Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results unless he wins, baselessly claimed that the Democrats are “demonic” and “a bunch of cheats,” and suggested that Kamala Harris is nothing more than a “vessel.” Trump also complained about a new poll that shows him lagging behind in Iowa, a state he twice carried, saying “We got all this crap going on with the press and with fake stuff and fake polls,” suggesting that the poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom was put out by “one of my enemies.” And, at rally after rally, Trump has urged his supporters to deliver a victory “too big to rig," telling them: “The only thing that can stop us is the cheating. It’s the only thing that can stop us." In 2020, Trump prematurely declared victory from the White House, launched a legal and political effort to overturn his loss, which resulted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Since then, Congress has passed the Electoral Count Reform Act, which makes it harder to stop the certification of the results by Congress on Jan. 6, which Trump tried to do four years ago.

2/ **Trump suggested that Liz Cheney should have guns “trained on her face," wondering how his prominent Republican critic would fare “with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her.”** During an interview with Tucker Carlson, Trump said Cheney "is a very dumb individual, very dumb. She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face." Cheney responded in a post on social media that “this is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.” Kamala Harris, meanwhile, said Trump’s violent rhetoric about Cheney “must be disqualifying. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-tucker-carlson.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/liz-cheney-trump-guns-shooting/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-calls-out-trump-00186804) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-01/trump-invokes-violent-rhetoric-against-cheney-drawing-blowback) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/g-s1-31443/2024-election-trump-harris-cheney) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/01/trump-liz-cheney-guns-trained) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-attacks-liz-cheney-war-hawk-guns-trained-on-her-face/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/donald-trump-liz-cheney-war-hawk-battle/))

3/ **Trump said he wouldn't "mind" if someone had to "shoot through the fake news" to get to him**. Trump made the remark while complaining about the bulletproof glass surrounding him onstage, saying: “I have this piece of glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news, right? And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind. I don’t mind.” Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, denied that Trump was wishing harm upon the media, but instead implying that the media was in danger and “should have had a glass protective shield, also.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/03/donald-trump-rally-fake-news-00186979) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/11/03/trump-rally-media-shooting/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/03/trump-pennsylvania-rally-media-shooting) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-presidential-election-a310fbc211ad8f0f5e290547ec284187))

* **Trump’s long legacy of inciting violence**. "No president has appealed to Americans’ darkest impulses or sought to turn them on one another like Trump has." ([Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-incitement-violence-great-replacement-puerto-rico-migrants/))

4/ **Trump didn’t rule out banning vaccines if he becomes president and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to remove fluoride from public water "sounds OK to me."** Trump said Kennedy Jr. would have a “big role in the administration” if he wins, calling the conspiracy theorists and vaccine skeptic a "very talented guy" who "has strong views." Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC,  support water fluoridation, citing studies showing that the mineral has reduced dental decay by at least 25%. The treatment of public water with small amounts of fluoride has been hailed as one of the most important public health interventions of the past century. Nevertheless, Kennedy Jr. said that among the first acts of a second Trump administration would be to “advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-rfk-jr-vaccines-fluoride.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/))

5/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans “probably will” try to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act if they control Congress and Trump wins the White House**. The CHIPS and Science Act was passed in 2022 and will invest more than $200 billion over a five-year period to help the U.S. regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing. So far, the CHIPS act has [allocated](https://x.com/mattcorridoni/status/1852477808909373858) $19.5 billion to Arizona, $75 million to Georgia, $325 million to Michigan, $750 million to North Carolina, and $93 million to Pennsylvania. Johnson later said he "misheard the question." Kamala Harris, meanwhile, said: “Let’s be clear about why he walked it back: Because it’s not popular, and their agenda is not popular. It is my plan and intention to continue to invest in American manufacturing, the work being done by American workers upholding and lifting up good union jobs.” Last week, Johnson said there would be “no Obamacare” if Trump won the White House, prompting the Trump campaign to issue a statement that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn’t a policy position. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/johnson-chips-act/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mike-johnson-chips-act-d5504f76d3aa0d5b401216f3592c9a09) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-02/harris-assails-speaker-over-call-to-repeal-semiconductor-money) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/02/mike-johnson-chips-act-repeal-democrats) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/harris-slams-mike-johnson-gop-repeal-chips-act-rcna178513))

6/ **At a rally hours before the election, the Republican Party’s presidential candidate used a microphone holder on his podium to pantomime the act of giving fellatio**. After he experienced microphone problems, Trump asked his supporters: “Do you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage? I get so angry. I’m up here seething. I’m seething, I’m working my ass off with this stupid mic. I’m blowing out my left arm, now I’m going to blow out my right arm and I’m blowing out my damn throat too because of these stupid people.” Trump then took the microphone off the stand and began simulating fellatio.
