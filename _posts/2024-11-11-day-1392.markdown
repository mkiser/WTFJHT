1/ **Trump demanded that the next Senate Republican leader allow him to make appointments to his administration and the courts without Senate approval**. Trump, who has promised to be dictator “for Day One,” insisted that the next Senate Republican leader make it possible for him to fast-track his nominations over any opposition. "Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,” Trump tweeted. “Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again.” Recess appointments allow a president to temporarily install a cabinet or other nominee for the rest of the two-year session. Elon Musk, meanwhile, has been advising Trump on staffing decisions. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/10/trump-rick-scott-senate-cornyn-thune-mcconnell/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-demands-republicans-allow-some-nominees-to-bypass-senate-1b59c08c) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/trump-presses-next-republican-senate-leader-recess-appointments-00188640) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/trump-senate-administration-hearings) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elon-musk-weighing-trump-staffing-decisions-sources/story?id=115730434))

* **💭 Why does this matter?** Trump’s push to use recess appointments reveals a strategic attempt to circumvent Senate confirmation delays, enhancing executive control over key appointments even in a divided government. This approach would allow Trump to swiftly install officials essential to advancing his policy goals without waiting for protracted Senate votes, which are often slowed by partisan disagreements. While this tactic is constitutional, it could create friction between the executive and legislative branches, straining traditional checks and balances. Trump’s move signals a proactive, forceful stance on executive power that could redefine the pace and independence of government operations, setting a precedent for future presidencies.

2/ **Trump named Stephen Miller his White House deputy chief of staff for policy**. Miller was the architect of some of Trump’s first-term immigration policies, including family separation and an order to ban travel into the U.S. from several majority-Muslim countries. Miller previously said a second Trump term would prioritize limiting asylum grants and work visas, punishing “sanctuary cities,” expanding the travel ban, and forcing the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/stephen-miller-expected-named-trumps-deputy-chief-staff-policy-rcna179602) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-stephen-miller-policy-immigration-9cc6ad3118779b23bff88022ca5e2260) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/trump-taps-miller-as-deputy-chief-as-immigration-takes-forefront) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-stephen-miller-white-house-deputy-chief-of-staff/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/stephen-miller-expected-to-be-named-trumps-deputy-chief-of-staff-for-policy.html))

* **Trump tapped Susie Wiles, his co-campaign manager, as his White House chief of staff**. Wiles, the first woman to serve in the role, is viewed as the person responsible for keeping Trump more disciplined. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/07/donald-trump-susie-wiiles-chief-of-staff) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/donald-trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff-00188346))

3/ **Trump named Tom Homan his "Border Czar" with oversight of immigration, maritime, and aviation security**. Homan, who oversaw Trump’s first-term “zero tolerance” family separation policy as acting ICE director, said the enforcement will be the “same as it was during the first administration” but Americans can expect “a hell of a lot more” deportations this time. The policy resulted in thousands of undocumented migrant children were separated from family members. In a separate [interview](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/trump-tom-homan-mass-deportation-zh82rbswc), Homan said "We're going to concentrate on the worst of the worst \[...\] It's going to be a lot different to what the liberal media is saying it's going to be." The role does not require Senate confirmation. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/11/tom-homan-border-czar-trump/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/trump-picks-former-immigration-chief-homan-as-his-border-czar) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-homan-ice-border-czar-7dea915b5ea43896390b8020d254f887) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/11/trumps-border-czar-deportation-plan) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/11/trump-taps-former-immigration-official-thomas-homan-as-border-czar-00188726) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-announces-tom-homan-incoming-border-czar-rcna179536) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/11/tom-homan-border-czar-transitions-donald-trump/76193602007/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-00188776))

4/ **Trump chose Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations**. Stefanik has served as the chair of the House Republican Conference since 2021, making her the fourth-ranking Republican in the House. She’s, a staunch defender of Israel in its response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, repeatedly accused the U.N. of antisemitism, and previously called for a "a complete reassessment of U.S. funding of the United Nations" if Israel were expelled from the General Assembly for human rights violations and war crimes in Gaza. The nomination requires Senate confirmation. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/g-s1-33696/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/11/trump-stefanik-us-ambassador-united-nations/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/11/elise-stefanik-un-ambassador-trump-00188681) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/11/trump-elise-stefanik-un-ambassador) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-united-nations-elise-stefanik-ambassador-2b482fb39a8d6f03d389d27cc8820056))

5/ **A judge granted Special Counsel Jack Smith’s request to pause all filing deadlines in the federal case accusing Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election**. Judge Tanya Chutkan approved Smith’s request to give the Justice Department time to assess the implications of Trump’s return to the presidency and the department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Smith and his team face a Dec. 2 deadline to report back with a status update on whether the case will proceed. Although Smith has paused this case, he has not taken similar action in the separate classified documents case, which was dismissed earlier this year and is now under appeal. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-jan-6-case.html))

6/ **Trump will receive classified briefings again despite being charged with mishandling state secrets**. Despite facing charges related to the mishandling of classified information, Trump will resume classified briefings as he prepares to transition back into office. The Biden administration has committed to facilitating an orderly transition, including providing Trump with access to sensitive national security information, a decision drawing concerns from intelligence officials wary of his past handling of such information. Although intelligence agencies traditionally offer classified briefings to President-elects, some experts, like former National Intelligence Council chair Gregory Treverton, see challenges ahead given Trump’s history with sensitive data, which previously raised alarms about security risks and operational integrity. ([Time](https://time.com/7174648/donald-trump-classified-documents/))

* **💡 Why should I care?** As Trump resumes access to classified briefings, public concern over information security and responsible governance rises. Sensitive briefings prepare a president to navigate complex international relations and domestic security challenges, but when a president-elect has faced charges for mishandling classified information, it can prompt doubts about information protection and trust in leadership. For voters, this situation underscores the importance of accountability in handling national security and the stakes of electing leaders who will have access to the country’s most sensitive intelligence. Citizens have a vested interest in the protocols surrounding security briefings, as these ultimately impact national safety and public trust.

7/ **Trump, in a call with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, handed the phone Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellites have been essential for Ukrainian communications in the ongoing war with Russia**. Zelensky was reportedly somewhat reassured by what he heard from Trump, and Musk said he will continue supporting Ukraine with Starlink. Separately, Trump urged Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him about the U.S. military’s presence in Europe. Trump has promised to quickly resolve the conflict, suggesting that Ukraine may need to concede some territories to achieve peace, but has not offered any concrete details about how he intends to do so – just concepts of a plan. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-musk-zelensky.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/10/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call))

* **💭 Why does this matter?** Musk’s involvement underscores his influence over U.S. defense and foreign policy, especially as he’s a significant government contractor and has supported Trump’s campaign. Any changes to U.S. aid policies in Ukraine could shift the dynamics of the war, potentially weakening Ukraine's defenses and emboldening Russia, while altering America's role in European security.

* **🧩 What's at stake?** If Trump’s approach leads to compromises that recognize Russian-held territories, it could weaken the principle of national sovereignty that underpins international law. The outcome may affect NATO's unity, as allies could view this as a shift in U.S. commitment to Europe. For Ukraine, such diplomacy might bring a fragile peace but at the cost of sovereignty, potentially reshaping Europe’s borders and security assurances, which could have ramifications beyond Ukraine for decades to come.

8/ **A Manhattan judge will rule on whether Trump’s hush money conviction stands under the Supreme Court’s ruling that presidents are immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office**. In May, Trump was [convicted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t) of 34 counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records. Trump’s lawyers argue the case should be thrown out, claiming that some evidence improperly involved his presidential actions, while prosecutors contend that the charges focus on his personal conduct, which is not protected. If the verdict stands, sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26, though Trump’s legal team may seek further delays or a federal court transfer. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-immunity-hush-money-merchan-stormy-daniels-02e54baf65b233ad7f6875536fb998ea) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-decide-whether-trumps-hush-money-conviction-can-stand-2024-11-10/))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump won Arizona, sweeping all seven of this year’s battleground states**. Trump won 312 electoral votes – the best performance for a Republican since George H.W. Bush – and also won the national popular vote, making him the first Republican to do so since George W. Bush in 2004. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/us/politics/trump-wins-arizona.html))

2. **Control of the House is still too close to call**. There are 18 uncalled House races. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to win the majority. So far, Democrats have flipped four seats and are leading in two of the seven remaining Republican-held competitive seats. Republicans, however, have flipped three seats, and are leading in two of the eight remaining Democratic-held competitive seats. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33301/2024-house-seats-undecided-control) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/07/house-election-results-control-count))

3. **Congress moves to extend government shutdown deadline to March, aligning with Trump’s inauguration and Republican-led legislative agenda**. To avoid a government shutdown, Congress is considering a funding extension to March. While some Republicans originally opposed a six-month extension proposed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, a short-term solution now seems the only viable path, especially with limited working days left. Democrats, aiming to avoid a shutdown, are likely to support the extension, though they continue to push for a permanent funding deal. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/11/trump-government-shutdown-deadline/))

4. **The Iranian government ordered an operative to assassinate Trump before the 2024 election**, Manhattan federal prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors unsealed charges that Iranian agents, acting under Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, had devised assassination plans targeting Trump and Brooklyn-based activist Masih Alinejad. The IRGC allegedly directed Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national now in Iran, to lead the plots, recruiting accomplices to surveil and potentially kill both targets. Following Trump’s January 2020 strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, Iran has issued threats and engaged in plots, intensifying security concerns around U.S. officials. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/08/donald-trump-iran-assassination-plot-00188498) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/iran-trump-assassination-plot.html))

5. **Justice Sonia Sotomayor intends to stay on Supreme Court despite calls from some progressives to retire before Trump takes office**. Sotomayor, the senior liberal on the Supreme Court, intends to remain on the bench despite calls for her retirement to allow Biden to appoint a successor before Trump takes office. Citing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s 2020 death as a cautionary example, some progressives worry that Sotomayor’s seat could ultimately be filled by Trump, further shifting the court’s ideological balance rightward. Sotomayor is 70 and remains active in court proceedings and public engagements. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/justice-sonia-sotomayor-is-expected-to-remain-on-supreme-court-2aaf62e0) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/politics/sonia-sotomayor-supreme-court-remain/index.html))

### 🔍 Dept. of Context and Consequence.

*A deeper look at today’s headlines – why it matters and what’s at stake.*

 1. **Many Trump voters support progressive policies but lack awareness of his regressive agenda, study suggests**. A surprising number of Trump supporters backed progressive ballot measures, including abortion rights and minimum wage increases, while also voting for a candidate whose policies through Project 2025 threaten these very protections. This trend reveals an information gap; many Trump voters appear misinformed about his actual platform, relying on sources like social media and personal networks instead of journalism. The rise of social media as a news source has contributed to this dissonance, where voters may support progressive measures yet back candidates who actively oppose them, underscoring the impact of media consumption on voter understanding. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/08/americas-political-discordance-the-want-progressivism/))

 2. **Trump’s populist campaign won voters over economic woes, but his policies are likely to benefit elites, not the working class**. The 2024 election saw Trump win largely due to economic discontent, not a broad endorsement of his divisive policies, with many swing voters disillusioned by high inflation and other financial pressures. While Trump’s populist rhetoric resonated, he is likely to deliver policies benefiting the wealthy, including tax cuts for the richest Americans, rather than the working-class support he promised. Historically, Republican leaders like Reagan have employed similar strategies—championing populist messages while enacting pro-elite policies. This dissonance may eventually lead to backlash from voters if economic gains for everyday Americans fail to materialize, potentially exposing the inconsistency between Trump’s populist promises and plutocratic policies. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-americans-vote-plutocrats-taxes-1235161296/))

 3. **Inflation outpaces unemployment as voters’ top economic concern, shaping lessons for Democrats after Trump’s victory**. In a reflection on Trump’s 2024 win, Noah Smith argues that the Democrats misjudged the political impact of inflation, which voters often see as a greater economic burden than unemployment. While the Biden administration pursued aggressive fiscal policies to promote full employment, inflation in 2021-22 eroded Americans’ purchasing power, leaving many frustrated. Smith suggests that Democrats, influenced by progressive economic advisors focused on job creation, underestimated voters’ sensitivity to rising prices, a factor that might have contributed significantly to the election outcome. For future campaigns, Smith advises Democrats to heed inflation concerns more closely, as public backlash against inflation may overshadow other economic gains. ([Noah Smith – Noahpinion](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/americans-hate-inflation-more-than))

 4. **Trump’s proposed tariffs could harm the economy, but the Supreme Court may face a choice between upholding law or protecting political interests**. Trump’s proposed tariffs, which include a 10-20% tax on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods from China, are likely to drive up inflation and reduce economic growth. While the Supreme Court could block these tariffs through the “major questions doctrine,” this legal tool has historically been used only against policies from Democratic presidents, such as Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. The justices now face a dilemma: uphold Trump’s tariff authority, risking potential economic fallout that could harm the GOP, or intervene, thus solidifying their power to veto executive actions even when those actions are legally permitted. ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/scotus/383884/supreme-court-donald-trump-tariffs-inflation-economy))

 5. **Markets react to Trump's re-election with strategic bets on deregulation, oil, crypto — and high volatility**. The stock market surged on Trump’s re-election news, with gains concentrated in sectors expected to benefit from his pro-business stance, while others brace for disruption. Investors anticipate Trump will cut taxes, deregulate industries, expand oil drilling, and promote a hands-off approach to crypto, driving rapid gains in financial, fossil fuel, and cryptocurrency stocks. However, there are signs of uncertainty: stocks tied to renewable energy and consumer staples dipped, reflecting anticipated policy clashes over deregulation and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s potential influence on health-related restrictions. Interest rates rose as traders braced for inflation risks linked to Trump’s proposed tariffs and deficit-spending policies, underscoring a new market reality shaped by the unpredictability of his administration’s decisions. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/wall-street-trump-whim-economy/680605/))

 6. **Crypto industry’s record election spending pays off with GOP victories and new political allies**. The cryptocurrency industry spent an unprecedented $135 million on the 2024 election cycle, securing favorable results with the victory of pro-crypto candidates, including Donald Trump, who shifted to supporting crypto. Crypto companies, led by Coinbase and industry-backed PACs like Fairshake, strategically funded political campaigns to advance a more favorable regulatory environment, opposing figures like SEC Chair Gary Gensler and pro-regulation politicians. With Trump and a new Senate majority supportive of crypto-friendly policies, the industry expects deregulation efforts and other priorities to move forward in Congress. This unprecedented election influence signals crypto's emergence as a major special interest group, with even skeptical Democratic leaders being pushed to reconsider their stances. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-08/crypto-world-takes-victory-lap-after-big-us-election-bet-pays-off))

 7. **Difficulty in holding Trump accountable for his past actions led swing voters to perceive his presidency more positively, contributing to his 2024 win**. The Harris campaign found it challenging to convince undecided voters that Trump’s first term had been harmful, as many voters saw issues like the Covid-19 recession and the repeal of reproductive rights as beyond Trump’s control. Internal data showed that many swing voters associated Trump’s term with pre-pandemic economic stability and did not hold him responsible for issues like job losses or the end of Roe v. Wade. Democrats may have underestimated the need to counteract Trump’s ongoing positive framing, missing early opportunities to challenge his record effectively. ([The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/188238/trump-won-voter-perception-2024))

 8. **Social media reshapes voter behavior, as news consumption shifts and local news declines**. A key factor in voting behavior this year was the role of media consumption, especially the rise of social media as a primary news source among young people, Latinos, and specific demographics like young men and suburban women. Social media platforms, particularly YouTube, TikTok, and X, now dominate information sources for many, often delivering more partisan and sometimes misleading content compared to traditional outlets. This trend is also linked to the decline of local news, which has created a vacuum filled by more polarized, online sources, reshaping how voters understand issues and make political choices. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/09/social-media-traditional-news-elections-00188548))

 9. **Right-wing media’s growing dominance influences public perception, aiding Trump’s 2024 win by shaping his image and downplaying his controversies**. This article argues that Trump’s 2024 victory wasn’t driven by economic factors but by a right-wing media ecosystem, including Fox News, Newsmax, and various social media influencers, which sways public opinion with carefully crafted narratives that favor him. Right-wing media prioritizes stories that amplify economic woes under Democratic leadership while undermining or erasing controversies involving Trump, painting him as a champion for the average American. The piece suggests that this media influence has become more impactful than mainstream outlets, allowing Trump to win by controlling the stories voters see and hear. ([The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/185669/trump-incoherence-new-york-times-ignores))

10. **Trump’s media coverage sparks revenue boom, highlighting challenges in balanced political journalism**. As Trump approaches a second presidency, Matthew Yglesias reflects on how Trump’s chaotic style, scandals, and polarizing statements have consistently boosted media ratings, driving the industry to prioritize sensational stories that keep audiences engaged. Although many journalists do not ideologically support Trump, the economic incentives of Trump-centered reporting have fostered a cycle where controversy and outrage—rather than nuanced political coverage—take precedence. Meanwhile, Biden’s relatively stable presidency has seen a steep drop in media engagement, revealing a challenge for Democrats: traditional news outlets may not be incentivized to cover more subdued political styles, as attention and revenue often follow Trump’s sensationalism. Yglesias suggests that the media’s economic interests might affect election coverage in subtle but significant ways, favoring Trump not through intent, but through the powerful draw of viewership metrics.
