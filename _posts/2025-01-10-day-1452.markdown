1/ **Trump was sentenced to no punishment for orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records**. In the days leading up to his sentencing, Trump asked the New York appeals court, New York’s highest court, and the U.S. Supreme Court all to block the proceedings. He argued that the Supreme Court’s July ruling that [presidents are entitled to “absolute immunity from criminal prosecution”](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/01/day-1259/#1-the-supreme-court-ruled-6-3-that-t) for “official acts” meant the case should be thrown out. All refused to intervene. Today – 10 days before being sworn into the oval office for a second term – Trump received an unconditional discharge. Meaning, Trump will not face any consequence for his criminal conduct. The conviction, however, will remain on his record, making Trump the first former – and returning – president convicted of a felony. “Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,” New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, who oversaw Trump’s six-week trial, said during the sentencing. “This has been truly an extraordinary case.” During the hearing, New York prosecutors recapped the “overwhelming evidence” that Trump engaged in a "direct attack on the rule of law," attempted to "undermine its legitimacy" by attacking the judge and others involved in the case, and "purposefully bred disdain for our institutions and the rule of law." Trump's defense team, meanwhile, said the case should never have been brought and called it a "sad day for this country." After he was sentenced, Trump vowed to appeal, saying: “Today’s event was a despicable charade, and now that it is over, we will appeal this Hoax, which has no merit, and restore the trust of Americans in our once great System of Justice.” In May, a jury of 12 New Yorkers [convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t) related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Just six months later, [America elected the first convicted felon to serve as president of the United States](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/11/06/day-1387/#1-america-elected-the-first-convicte). In doing so, Trump – the twice-impeached, four-times indicted, once-defeated former president – overcame his felony convictions, 88 criminal charges, accusations of insurrection, civil lawsuit judgments totaling more than a half-billion dollars, allegations by his first-term cabinet that he’s unfit to serve, his openly fascist intentions, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, his failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic that led to more than 400,000 deaths from a virus he repeatedly claimed was “going to disappear,” his repeated overt acts of racism, at least 26 public accusations of rape, kissing, and groping without consent, and his promises to prosecute his political opponents to become the nation’s 47th president. Trump, meanwhile, framed his no-penalty sentence as a win, saying the “Radical Democrats have lost another pathetic, unAmerican Witch Hunt.” He added: "This has been a very terrible experience [...] I am totally innocent. I did nothing wrong."

2/ **A federal appeals court ruled that special counsel Jack Smith’s report on Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election can be released**, though a temporary injunction delays publication for three days to allow potential appeals. The report details Smith’s findings from two now-dismissed criminal cases against Trump, including alleged election interference and mishandling of classified documents, which were dropped following Trump’s re-election due to Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of sitting presidents. Attorney General Merrick Garland intends to release the report’s first volume, focused on election subversion, once permitted by the courts, but Trump’s team has criticized the report as politically motivated and is considering further legal challenges.

3/ **The Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status for nearly one million immigrants**. Some 600,000 Venezuelans, more than 200,000 Salvadorans, about 100,000 people from Ukraine, and 1,900 from Sudan will be allowed shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. for 18 months. The move preempts Trump’s promised efforts to revoke protections.

### ✏️ Notables. 

1. **The Biden administration announced new sanctions targeting Russia’s energy sector**, focusing on oil producers, shipping networks, and a “shadow fleet” used to evade restrictions, days before Trump, who has vowed to end the Ukraine war, takes office. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-sanctions-energy-ukraine-war-biden-trump-bebf8f798e6212ee53b80e2eaea6e712) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/10/2025/us-announces-new-sanctions-on-russian-energy))

2. **Earth experienced its hottest year on record in 2024**, with global temperatures exceeding the 1.5°C threshold set by the Paris Agreement for the first time over a full calendar year, driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and compounded by natural events like El Niño. The record-breaking temperatures, confirmed by multiple scientific organizations, underscore the accelerating pace of climate change and its associated consequences, including extreme weather events, devastating wildfires, and rising sea levels. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-warming-hot-record-2024-disasters-12f899f071fcdbd051ad49a872611e92) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/2024-earth-hottest-year-paris-target) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/scientists-shocked-warm-2023-year-hotter/story?id=117417919) / [E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/its-official-2024-was-the-hottest-year-on-record/))

3. **Rudy Giuliani was held in contempt of court for the second time in a week** for defying court orders related to a defamation case brought by two Georgia election workers. A federal judge found Giuliani continued to make false claims about the workers despite a prior agreement to stop, and his failure to comply with asset disclosure requirements led to additional legal penalties. The judge warned Giuliani about the consequences of misusing his public platform to spread misinformation, emphasizing the seriousness of his actions. Giuliani has appealed a $146 million judgment in the defamation case while maintaining his statements are protected by the First Amendment. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/giuliani-expected-testify-second-contempt-hearing-defamation-case-rcna187117) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/rudy-giuliani-contempt-hearing-defamation-case/index.html))

4. **The U.S. added 256,000 jobs in December 2024 while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%**. Economists had expected about 155,000 jobs. The strong job growth caps a resilient labor market throughout 2024, with key sectors like healthcare, government, and retail driving gains. Wage growth continued steadily at 3.9% year-over-year, but the robust report dampened expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in early 2025 due to inflation concerns. Biden highlighted this achievement as part of his administration’s economic legacy, while concerns remain over potential labor market impacts from Trump’s proposed policies.

5. **Americans rate Biden’s presidency less favorably than Trump’s or Obama’s at the end of their terms**, with only about a quarter viewing Biden as a “good” or “great” president. Black and Hispanic Americans expressed particular disappointment, and younger Americans were especially critical, with only 1 in 10 under 30 giving Biden high marks. While Biden oversaw major legislation, many Americans felt he failed to deliver on key promises, leaving nearly half saying their families are worse off than when he took office.
