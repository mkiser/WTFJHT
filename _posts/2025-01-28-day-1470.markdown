1/ **The Trump administration ordered a temporary freeze on all federal grants and loans**. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget, issued late Monday, directed federal agencies to pause the obligation and disbursement of federal financial assistance to review whether programs comply with recent executive orders targeting initiatives such as diversity, equity, and inclusion, environmental policies, and abortion-related funding. Although the freeze doesn’t apply to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or direct assistance programs like food stamps and Pell Grants, many other federally funded programs, like healthcare, education, disaster relief, and housing, face potential disruption. The freeze is set to begin Tuesday at 5 p.m. and will remain in place while agencies submit detailed reviews of their programs by mid-February. A lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups seeks an emergency injunction to block the order, and at least 22 state attorneys general plan to sue the Trump administration. The attorneys general, led by Connecticut AG William Tong, called the policy “lawless” and “brazenly unconstitutional.” Republican leaders, meanwhile, largely support the review as a necessary step to align federal spending with conservative priorities, though some expressed concern over the disruption it has caused. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attempted to clarify the freeze, saying "this is not a blanket pause" and that "individual assistance" like Social Security, Medicare, and food stamps will not be affected by the pause. Leavitt added that  the "reason for this is to ensure that every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions this president has taken." The OMB memo announcing the freeze said: “The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.” It lists over 2,600 programs under review, including school meals, foreign aid, cancer research, and disaster relief.

2/ **Democrats criticized Trump’s federal funding freeze as unconstitutional**, calling it a direct attack on Congress’s authority and American families. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the move “a dagger at the heart of the average American family in red states and blue states, in cities, in suburbs, in rural areas.” Senator Patty Murray argued, “Congress holds the power of the purse. That is very clear in the Constitution.” New York Attorney General Letitia James announced lawsuits, stating, “We won’t sit idly by while this administration harms our families.” Democrats warned the freeze undermines bipartisan funding agreements and creates widespread uncertainty for states, nonprofits, and critical programs. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/28/congress/schumer-murray-funding-freeze-00200955) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-federal-grants-pause.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/28/trump-presidency-news/#link-3BDURCLZEFEUVOC5CDEHAIJSGA))

3/ **Trump’s freeze on federal grants and loans disrupted Medicaid operations nationwide**, with state officials reporting that the federal portal used for Medicaid reimbursements was inaccessible. The outage, which came hours after the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo halting financial assistance programs for a review, raised concerns about the continuity of payments to the program that serves over 70 million Americans. While the White House stated that Medicaid was excluded from the freeze and payments were still being processed, confusion and panic spread among state Medicaid offices, healthcare providers, and patients. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/28/us/trump-news-executive-orders/medicaid-freeze?smid=url-share) / [Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/donald-trump/2025/01/28/illinois-medicaid-federal-funding-freeze-trump-administration) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5111210-trump-freeze-medicaid-access/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicaid-head-start-health-centers-trump-funding-freeze/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/trump-funding-freeze-medicaid-state-portals-omb.html))

4/ **The Trump administration placed dozens of senior U.S. Agency for International Development officials on administrative leave** for allegedly attempting to "circumvent" an executive order freezing nearly all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days. Acting USAID Administrator Jason Gray announced the decision in a memo, citing actions that didn’t align with Trump’s mandate. The move affects around 60 top career officials, including the entire leadership of USAID’s global health bureau, leaving many offices without senior management. The aid freeze, which impacts programs addressing poverty, disease, and disaster relief, has drawn criticism from global leaders and aid advocates, who warn of severe consequences for vulnerable communities. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276382/trump-usaid-leave-executive-order) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/27/top-usaid-career-staff-ordered-leave-00200854) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-usaid-officials.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/27/trump-presidency-news/#link-KRA5MANQXNEQRAIPKG7SFLMTWU))

5/ **Trump fired Jennifer Abruzzo, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, and Gwynne Wilcox, one of its Democratic members**, effectively paralyzing the agency responsible for enforcing workers' union rights. The firings leave the NLRB with only two members, preventing it from issuing rulings on hundreds of pending labor disputes. While Abruzzo's removal was anticipated, Wilcox's dismissal was unprecedented and could face legal challenges, as federal law permits board members to be removed only for neglect or malfeasance. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-28/trump-fires-nlrb-general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-fires-us-labor-board-member-hobbling-agency-amid-legal-battles-2025-01-28/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-nlrb-jennifer-abruzzo.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/28/trump-nlrb-gwynne-wilcox))

6/ **The Trump administration halted the distribution of HIV medications purchased through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and froze funding for global health programs**. Clinics in low-income countries have been instructed to stop disbursing lifesaving drugs already in stock, and PEPFAR’s data systems have been taken offline. The freeze affects treatment for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, leaving millions of patients without care and disrupting critical global health programs. The administration also suspended technical support to health ministries and aid organizations abroad, sparking fears of increased disease transmission and drug resistance. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/health/pepfar-trump-freeze.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-order-set-halt-supply-hiv-malaria-drugs-poor-countries-sources-say-2025-01-28/))

7/ **Trump signed executive orders targeting transgender service members**, reinstating a partial ban from his first term and ordering revisions to military policies on medical standards and pronoun usage. The orders reverse Biden-era policies allowing transgender individuals to serve openly and receive transition-related care. Trump argued that gender dysphoria and related medical needs are incompatible with military readiness, saying “A man’s assertion that he is a woman \[...\] is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/28/trump-transgender-troops-military-hegseth/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-executive-order-transgender-military-dei-rcna189470) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-executive-orders-military/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/28/trump-presidency-news/#link-VVQDQ4ROFNHYREPEMJXOATIH5E) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5276839/trump-executive-order-dei-military))

8/ **ICE plans to target three U.S. cities each week for large-scale immigration operations**. Aurora, Colorado, will be the next city targeted after Chicago and New York City, with ICE agents following a directive to arrest 1,200-1,500 migrants daily. Since Jan. 23, nearly 3,600 immigrants have been arrested, including many with no criminal records. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/ice-conduct-major-immigration-operations-three-cities-week-rcna189608) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-28/ice-expands-focus-to-new-york-city-after-chicago-raids) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-ramps-up-deportation-effort-after-slow-start-546d9954))

9/ **The U.S. resumed deportation flights to Colombia after Trump threatened tariffs, visa cancellations, and customs delays in response to Colombia's brief refusal to accept military flights carrying migrants**. Colombian President Gustavo Petro initially rejected U.S. deportation flights, citing concerns over "dignified treatment" after reports of migrants being shackled during transit. Colombia’s refusal stemmed from prior commitments under the Biden administration that deportations would respect migrants’ dignity, prompting Petro to offer Colombian planes for deportations while asserting sovereignty. Trump responded with threats of a 25% tariff on Colombian exports, including crude oil, coffee, and flowers, as well as visa revocations for Colombian officials. A late-night agreement allowed deportations to continue, with Colombia deploying its own planes to retrieve 201 migrants from the U.S. While Trump declared victory, Petro claimed to uphold the dignity of returning Colombians, saying "Migrants are not delinquents. They are human beings who want to work and get ahead in life."

 3. **Sen. Thom Tillis assured Danielle Hegseth, Pete Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, that her sworn statement alleging alcohol abuse and abusive behavior could sway Republican senators to oppose Hegseth’s nomination as defense secretary**.

 8. **Senate Democrats introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s pardons of Jan. 6 rioters**, focusing on those who assaulted Capitol Police officers. The resolution is symbolic and highlights opposition to Trump’s sweeping clemency for over 1,500 rioters, which Democrats view as an endorsement of political violence. No Republican senators co-sponsored the resolution. The resolution requires unanimous Senate consent, meaning a single senator could block it.

Google stated this aligns with its longstanding practice of reflecting official government sources.
