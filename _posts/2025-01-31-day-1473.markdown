1/ **Trump’s Justice Department fired dozens of federal prosecutors and FBI officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigations**, initiating a broad review of thousands of agents and staff who worked on cases related to Trump and the Capitol riot he inspired. More than 30 federal prosecutors were dismissed from the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office, and at least eight senior FBI executives were fired or pressured to retire. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove accused the Biden administration of improperly hiring these officials and cited Trump’s executive order to “end the weaponization” of law enforcement. FBI officials were ordered to provide a list of all employees involved in Trump-related investigations. The FBI Agents Association warned that these removals could "severely weaken" the bureau’s ability to address national security threats. Trump denied direct involvement but said, "If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing."

2/ **Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blocked Jan. 6 rioters from state jobs**, rejecting Trump’s pardons and calling their actions "infamous and disgraceful." The move, likely to face legal challenges, is the first direct state opposition to Trump’s executive orders.

3/ **The Trump administration ordered the removal of HIV, LGBTQ\+, and gender identity-related data from the CDC website**. A Jan. 29 memo directed federal agencies to scrub references to "gender ideology," replace “gender” with “sex,” and take down all outward-facing content promoting DEI initiatives. The CDC removed multiple webpages, including HIV data, resources for at-risk populations, and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, which tracks health behaviors among teenagers. Scientists, researchers, and public health officials warned that the purge could severely impact disease tracking, HIV prevention, and outreach efforts for marginalized communities. The administration also paused external communications from federal health agencies, limiting transparency about the scope of the removals. Other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services, also deleted webpages containing information on minority health and reproductive rights. The administration also ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA to remove references to climate science and sustainability initiatives.

* **The Trump administration ordered employees to remove pronouns from email signatures** and scrub gender identity references from official materials to comply with Trump’s executive order against “gender ideology.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-employees-told-remove-pronouns-email-signatures-end/story?id=118310483) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/trump-pronouns.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/31/agencies-end-initiatives-promoting-gender-ideology/78094141007/))

4/ **Elon Musk’s aides at the Office of Personnel Management  blocked career civil servants from accessing key federal employee data systems**. This sudden restriction has raised concerns about cybersecurity risks and the potential for unauthorized use of government personnel records. One OPM official warned, "We have no visibility into what they are doing with the computer and data systems. That is creating great concern." The full extent of the access changes remains unclear, as Musk’s team, which includes former employees from his companies, has not communicated directly with career staff. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/) / [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-general-services-administration/))

5/ **Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Saturday**. Canada, Mexico, and China vowed to retaliate, with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau calling the tariffs “disastrous.” Economists estimate that the tariffs could shrink U.S. economic output and cost American households an average of $830 annually. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-fentanyl-e526616cdcb7fc596ed999cb89ee2265) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/31/trump-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-begin-saturday-white-house-says.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/31/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-taxes))

6/ **The Trump administration emailed air traffic controllers urging them to quit their jobs** a day after a deadly plane crash in D.C. Trump defended the move, blaming diversity hiring for the Army helicopter and American Airlines jet colliding and killing 67 people. The majority of U.S. air traffic control facilities are understaffed, with 285 out of 313 operating below recommended levels. Some locations, including major hubs in New York, are missing nearly 40% of their workforce. ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-emails-air-traffic-controllers-quit-your-jobs/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/air-traffic-controllers-understaffed.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/plane-crash-washington-dc-trump-dei-claims-3ac5486ec594d81e919e8ebbd9733869))

7/ **Trump ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to release large amounts of water from two California dams**, citing the need for firefighting resources. Local water managers were given an hour’s notice and warned of potential flooding. Experts questioned the administration’s reasoning, noting that transporting the water to Los Angeles would be nearly impossible and that local reservoirs were already full. Sen. Alex Padilla called the lack of coordination “recklessly endanger\[ed\] residents downstream.” ([Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-31/trump-california-dams-opened-up) / [SJV Water](https://sjvwater.org/trumps-emergency-water-order-responsible-for-water-dump-from-tulare-county-lakes/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/trump-california-water-00201909))

8/ **A Louisiana grand jury indicted a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a minor** – the first known criminal case against an out-of-state abortion provider since Roe v. Wade fell. Louisiana issued a warrant, but New York state vowed to block extradition. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-indictment-lousiana-new-york-doctor-63ff4d9da8a9b592a7ca4ec7ba538cd3) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/health/abortion-louisiana-new-york-prosecution-shield-law.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/31/abortion-doctor-indictment-criminal-louisiana-new-york/) / [WAFB](https://www.wafb.com/2025/01/31/la-grand-jury-indicts-ny-doctor-who-prescribed-abortion-pill-local-teen-took/))

9/ **A federal judge blocked Trump’s attempt to freeze federal aid, ruling that the policy likely violates the Constitution and that the administration’s rescission of the freeze was “in name-only.”** The ruling followed lawsuits from 22 states arguing that the freeze violated the separation of powers since only Congress controls federal spending. Although the administration had withdrawn the memo ordering the freeze, McConnell ruled that the policy remained in effect based on a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said the funding freeze was still being enforced. The judge also cited the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which bars presidents from unilaterally withholding funds approved by Congress. The ruling expands on an earlier decision by another judge who had temporarily blocked the freeze earlier in the week. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/second-judge-blocks-trump-federal-aid-funding-freeze-rcna190249) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-trump-freezing-federal-spending-22-states-2025-01-31/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/judge-block-trump-spending-freeze-00201899))

10/ **Paramount is in talks with Trump to settle his  $10 billion lawsuit against CBS**, which accused "60 Minutes" of deceptive editing. The FCC, now led by a Trump appointee, has requested CBS hand over unedited transcripts of the interview.‌ ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/paramount-trump-cbs-news-settlement.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/media/cbs-trump-settlement-60-minutes))
