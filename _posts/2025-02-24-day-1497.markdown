1/ **The U.S. voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine**, aligning itself with Russia and not its European allies. The resolution, backed by Ukraine and major European nations, demanded Russia’s withdrawal, with Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa calling it a “moment of truth” for the democratic world. The U.S. instead pushed its own resolution that omitted blame on Moscow, but then abstained from voting on it after amendments added strong language against Russia. Trump defended the U.S. position, saying Ukraine must “move fast” to negotiate peace or risk “not having a nation to lead.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-standoff-ukraine-europe-competing-un-resolutions-russia-ukraine-war-rcna193458) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/24/united-nations-ukraine-russia-trump/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/un-russia-ukraine-war-resolution-trump-zelenskyy-cde221e5850196776525403e788c272c) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/united-nations-ukraine-resolutions-00205744) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/us-joins-russia-ukraine-un-vote/index.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/24/ukraine-russia-un-resolution-trump))

* **The U.S. threatened to cut off Ukraine’s access to Starlink if Kyiv refused to sign a minerals deal granting the U.S. a 50% stake in Ukraine’s natural resources**. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the initial offer, which lacked security guarantees, leading to renewed pressure from U.S. officials. A source described Starlink as Ukraine’s “North Star,” warning that losing access would be a “massive blow.” Trump, who has tied mineral access to continued U.S. aid, claimed Kyiv was “very happy” with a revised deal and that Washington would “get our money back.” ([Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/us-threatens-to-shut-off-starlink-if-ukraine-wont-sign-minerals-deal-sources-tell-reuters/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/white-house-and-ukraine-close-in-on-deal-for-mineral-rights-e924c672) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/20/us-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-agreement) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-macron-ukraine-russia-starmer-8869d05f2cd8db5da277dd927cf959d4))

2/ **Trump fired Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown Jr., Adm. Lisa Franchetti, and several other top military leaders as part of a politically motivated purge of the Pentagon**. Trump framed the dismissals as a move to refocus the military on warfighting, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously attacked Brown and Franchetti for their involvement in diversity initiatives, calling military DEI efforts “the single dumbest phrase in military history.” The firings elevate Trump loyalist Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, a retired three-star general with no experience leading large military formations. Sen. Jack Reed warned that “firing uniformed leaders as a type of political loyalty test” undermines military professionalism. Despite the lack of a stated performance-based rationale for Brown’s removal, Trump offered a diplomatic farewell, calling him “a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/trump-fires-cq-brown-pentagon.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-fires-the-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-fd4a4d07) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/21/trump-joint-chiefs-of-staff-charles-brown-dan-caine/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-fires-chairman-joint-chiefs-staff-cq-brown-rcna193288) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hegseth-fire-remove-generals-senior-officers-us-officials/story?id=118985348))

* **Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Pentagon to prepare for budget cuts, demanding an 8% reduction annually over five years**, despite Trump’s past insistence on military expansion. The cuts, which Hegseth claims will “revive the warrior ethos,” would shift tens of billions away from existing programs to fund Trump’s priorities, including an “Iron Dome for America.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/hegseth-military-major-budget-cuts/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/))
 
3/ **The Trump administration fired 1,600 workers at the U.S. Agency for International Development and placed most remaining employees on administrative leave**. USAID employees received notices Sunday stating they were barred from conducting agency business or accessing official files, with only a small group designated for “mission-critical functions.” A federal judge allowed the cuts to proceed, ruling that the U.S. had “identified plausible harms that could ensue if its actions with respect to USAID are not permitted to resume.” Critics argue the move effectively dismantles U.S. foreign aid, with one USAID official calling it “illegal and unconstitutional, period,” and another expressing shock that their food programs “will have to stop.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/23/trump-usaid-2000-layoffs/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/usaid-trump-musk-foreign-aid-firings-a3af8ce6ef17878b718c8e2ed3bf98e4) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-usaid-employees-firing.html))

* **The Supreme Court temporarily blocked Trump from firing Hampton Dellinger, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel**. Justices Gorsuch and Alito dissented, arguing that a lower court judge had “effectively commanded the president and other executive branch officials to recognize and work with someone whom the president sought to remove from office.” The Trump administration called the ruling an “unprecedented assault” on presidential power. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-maintains-pause-trump-bid-immediately-fire-watchdog-agen-rcna192643) / [Washington Post](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-special-counsel.html))

4/ **The IRS cut over 6,000 employees in the middle of tax season as part of the Trump administration’s push to downsize the federal workforce**. Most of the affected workers are probationary employees hired under the Inflation Reduction Act to improve tax enforcement and customer service. The layoffs are expected to slow tax processing, delay refunds, and reduce audits of wealthy individuals and corporations, prompting criticism from unions and tax experts. The National Treasury Employees Union is challenging the cuts in court, calling them “a recipe for economic disaster.” The White House defended the move, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett arguing that the IRS has more staff than needed and that not all employees are “fully occupied.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304220/irs-job-cuts-doge-tax-season) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/irs-workers-fired-tax-season-doge-102fbecb) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/20/irs-layoffs-trump-doge) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/irs-fires-employees-layoffs-trump.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-irs-start-laying-off-6000-employees-thursday-nyt-reports-2025-02-19/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/doge-irs-taxpayer-data-privacy/))

5/ **Federal agencies, including the FBI, State Department, and Pentagon, instructed employees not to comply with Elon Musk’s mandate requiring workers to list five accomplishments from the past week or risk termination**. Unions called the Trump-backed directive “plainly unlawful," while some lawmakers questioned its enforceability. Several agency heads, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, ordered staff to pause responses, citing security risks and chain-of-command protocols. Trump defended the initiative, calling it “genius” and suggesting that nonresponses indicated employees were not actually working. The administration later softened its stance, allowing agencies discretion in implementing the request, but confusion and resistance persist across the federal workforce.

* **Republican lawmakers faced voter backlash at town halls over Trump and Elon Musk’s budget cuts and mass federal layoffs**. Some Republicans acknowledged concerns, with one lawmaker warning that the cuts were happening “too much too fast.” Meanwhile, the White House dismissed the protests, calling them the reaction of “a few critics,” while polling showed a majority of Americans opposed the job losses. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/town-halls-republicans-feel-heat-trump-musks-firing-cutting-spree-rcna193164) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/21/doge-georgia-town-hall-gop/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/republicans-congress-town-halls-trump.html))

4. **Trump appointed conservative podcaster Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI**. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer, has no FBI experience and has promoted conspiracy theories about the bureau. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-names-conservative-podcaster-dan-bongino-deputy-fbi-director-rcna193395) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/24/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-deputy-director) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-selects-dan-bongino-as-deputy-fbi-director-10d0e8c4) / [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd2qrn1e2o) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/23/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-trump/))

5. **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating federal grants and contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion**. The ruling prevents enforcement of an executive order that required federal contractors and grant recipients to certify they do not engage in “equity-related” programs, which the court found too vague. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/trump-dei-executive-order-blocked/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-blocked-terminating-dei-related-federal-grants-rcna193285) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/21/us/trump-news/the-judges-ruling-temporarily-halts-any-stoppage-on-federal-diversity-initiatives))

6. **A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from conducting immigration enforcement operations in Quaker meeting houses, Baptist churches, and a Sikh temple while a lawsuit against the policy moves forward**.

([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/dhs-immigration-agents-churches-trump-7c12f2509966dadeba98e920578f24c2))

7. **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management from sharing personal data with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency**.

([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/judge-blocks-department-education-federal-personnel-office-sharing-dat-rcna193453) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/federal-judge-blocks-musks-doge-access-to-student-loan-borrowers-data.html))

9. **Organic farmers and environmental groups sued the Agriculture Department over the removal of climate data from government websites**.

10. **The Associated Press sued the Trump administration after its reporters were barred from covering White House events, including access to the Oval Office and Air Force One**. The lawsuit argues the restrictions violate First and Fifth Amendment protections and were imposed in retaliation for the AP’s refusal to adopt the administration’s use of "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico." The White House defended the decision, saying that press access is at the president’s discretion and doesn’t constitute a constitutional right. Other news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Fox News, have signed a letter urging the administration to reverse course.
