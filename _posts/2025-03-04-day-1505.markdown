1/ **Trump launched a trade war by imposing a 25% tariff on nearly all Canadian and Mexican goods and an additional 10% on Chinese imports, which triggered immediate retaliation**. Canada responded with 25% tariffs on $155 billion of U.S. goods and threatened further economic actions, Mexico pledged tariff and non-tariff countermeasures, and China raised tariffs up to 15% on U.S. farm products while blacklisting 15 American companies. Trump justified the tariffs by blaming Canada and Mexico for fentanyl trafficking, despite U.S. data showing nearly all fentanyl seizures occur at the southern border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the tariffs as “unjustified” and “very dumb,” accusing Trump of trying to “collapse the Canadian economy” to make annexation easier. “We will never be the 51st state,” Trudeau said. Trump dismissed the criticism and threatened further escalation: “Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also rejected Trump’s justification, calling his accusations about cartel activity “offensive, defamatory and without substance,” and vowed retaliation. Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested a deal with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as tomorrow, saying, “The President is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/tariffs-us-canada-mexico-china/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/03/china-retaliates-against-trump-tariffs/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-stock-market-today-03-04-2025) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/trump-puts-tariffs-thousands-goods-canada-mexico-risking-higher-prices-rcna194542) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/04/trump-trade-tariffs-reaction-00210319) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5317494/tariffs-fentanyl-canada-mexico-trump) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-tariffs-effect-canada-mexico-china-retaliates/story?id=119417925) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/lutnick-says-trump-considering-some-mexico-canada-tariff-relief) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-643086a6dc7ff716d876b3c83e3255b0) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/canada-us-tariffs-trump-trudeau) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/china-rejects-additional-us-tariffs-vows-to-take-countermeasures.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/economy/trade-mexico-canada-china-tariffs-trump-hnk-intl/index.html))

* **The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board called Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada the “dumbest” tariff move in history**. The editorial argues that the tariffs will harm U.S. consumers and businesses by disrupting supply chains and increasing vehicle prices by thousands of dollars. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-takes-the-dumbest-tariff-plunge-5da57946))

* **Trump’s tariffs will drive up the cost of everyday essentials for Americans**. Grocery bills will rise as produce from Mexico – like avocados, tomatoes, and bell peppers – becomes more expensive. Cars and gas will also cost more due to tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, adding an estimated $2,700 to vehicle prices. Electronics, including iPhones and laptops, will see price hikes as the U.S. increases tariffs on Chinese goods. Construction costs will go up, making new homes even more expensive. Experts say the average U.S. household will pay about $1,072 more per year due to these tariffs. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5284991/trump-tariffs-higher-prices-inflation-mexico-canada-china) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/trump-tariffs-impact-china-canada-mexico) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-32501c6e))

2/ **Economists and global trade experts warn of severe economic consequences from Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China**. The International Chamber of Commerce warned that escalating U.S. tariffs could trigger a global economic crisis comparable to the Great Depression. ICC Deputy Secretary-General Andrew Wilson said the risk of a severe downturn is “a coin-flip” unless the U.S. reconsiders its trade policies. Meanwhile, economists are increasingly concerned about a U.S. recession as financial indicators weaken, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasting a 2.8% GDP contraction for the first quarter of 2025. Treasury yields have fallen, oil prices have dropped below $70 a barrel, and economic data has disappointed. Lower-income households are struggling with debt, businesses are hesitating on investment, and a tariff war threatens supply chains. Inflation concerns are also growing, as 69% of Americans believe tariffs will raise prices. And amid all these signs of economic trouble, the Trump administration nevertheless proposed redefining how "economic growth" is measured by excluding government spending from GDP calculations. Critics argue the move could obscure the impact of federal policies and make it harder to assess the true state of the economy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/tariff-war-risks-sinking-world-into-new-great-depression-235fffeb) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-03-04/us-recession-odds-are-becoming-unsettlingly-high) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/04/gdp-government-spending-musk-lutnick-trump/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/economy/gdp-data-lutnick-commerce-secretary.html) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/politics/402410/trump-musk-lutnick-gdp-economic-data))

* **The S&P 500 has erased all gains since Trump’s election**, closing at 5,778.15, below its Nov. 5 level.([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-bump-disappears-as-the-sp-500-is-now-negative-since-the-election.html))

3/ **Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins suggested Americans raise backyard chickens to combat rising egg prices**. Rollins called backyard chickens "awesome" in a Fox News interview despite many Americans unable to keep chickens due a lack of the space or legal ability. Egg prices have surged due to a bird flu outbreak, with the USDA predicting a 41% increase this year. J.D. Vance, who previously made egg prices a key campaign issue, has been notably quiet despite prices hitting record highs under Trump. The administration has announced a $1.5 billion plan to address the issue, including biosecurity funding and increased egg imports. ([HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brooke-rollins-eggs-backyard-chickens_n_67c676c9e4b044c440ed7fa7) / [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/jd-vance-eggs-inflation/681902/) / [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-says-americans-should-farm-chickens-combat-egg-prices-2039178))

4/ **Trump paused all U.S. military aid to Ukraine following the Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where Trump and JD Vance accused him of being ungrateful**. The White House said the aid would remain frozen until Ukraine showed a “commitment” to peace negotiations with Russia, but it didn’t clarify what specific actions would satisfy that requirement. Zelenskyy called the meeting “regrettable,” proposed a limited ceasefire with Russia, and reaffirmed Ukraine’s willingness to finalize the minerals agreement, saying, “Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-a15a459c9a3a393d040478ebbe250a9e) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-orders-pause-military-aid-ukraine-wake-last-weeks-oval-office-cl-rcna194627) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/us-ukraine-military-aid-trump-zelensky) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/trump-pauses-military-aid-to-ukraine-after-clash-with-zelenskiy) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/u-s-hitting-brakes-on-flow-of-arms-to-ukraine-980a71d1) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/04/zelenskyy-trump-ukraine-deal-00210230) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/04/trump-ukraine-aid-pause-reaction/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/ukraine-us-trump-military-support.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/zelensky-calls-heated-meeting-with-trump-last-week-regrettable-f4742e07) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/ukraine-s-zelenskiy-says-he-is-ready-to-work-fast-to-end-war) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/europe/zelensky-trump-argument-comment-ukraine-intl/index.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/zelensky-trump-ukraine-military-aid-minerals-deal))

5/ **JD Vance dismissed a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine as "20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years."** Britain and France, the only countries to pledge troops so far, condemned the remark as disrespectful, citing their military support in the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Vance later denied referring to either nation, but didn’t clarify which country he was referring to. Meanwhile, British politicians condemned Vance’s statement, with Conservative MP James Cartlidge calling it "deeply disrespectful" and Nigel Farage saying Vance was "wrong, wrong, wrong." French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu also pushed back, saying that fallen French soldiers "deserve our respect and the respect of our allies." ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx7w7q7qzro) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-trashes-keir-starmer-emmanuel-macron-ukraine-peacekeeping-plan/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/jd-vance-denies-disrespecting-uk-france-over-ukraine-peacekeeping-force-2025-03-04/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/04/uk-mps-condemn-deeply-disrespectful-jd-vance-comments) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/jd-vance-uk-random-country.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5317553/jd-vance-europe-ukraine-fox))

6/ **White House adviser Alina Habba suggested that military veterans fired in the Trump administration’s federal workforce cuts may not be “fit to have a job at this moment.”** Habba defended the Department of Government Efficiency layoffs and suggested that taxpayer dollars should only fund employees who “actually work.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/trump-adviser-alina-habba-says-veterans-fired-doge-are-perhaps-not-fit-rcna194721) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5175917-alina-habba-suggests-some-veterans-not-fit-for-government-jobs/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-lawyer-alina-habba-questions-fired-veterans-fitness.html))

7/ **House Republicans were told to avoid hosting in-person town halls after facing angry constituents over federal spending cuts and layoffs by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency**. National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson advised members to hold virtual events instead. Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of avoiding accountability, with Rep. Ro Khanna and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing to hold events in Republican districts. Trump dismissed the backlash as orchestrated by "paid troublemakers," though no evidence supports the claim. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5175061-house-republicans-town-halls-protests/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-reps-encouraged-virtual-town-halls-after-fiery/story?id=119428704) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/04/congress/gop-town-halls-richard-hudson-00210024))

8/ **Trump will address Congress tonight at 9 p.m. ET**. He promised to "TELL IT LIKE IT IS" as he highlights his administration’s first six weeks in office, including federal job cuts, tariffs, and foreign policy shifts. Trump is expected to praise the work of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and push for increased funding for immigration enforcement. Democrats plan to counter by bringing guests affected by government cutbacks and wearing blue and yellow to show support for Ukraine. Outside Congress, protests against Trump’s policies are planned in all 50 states. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-congress-immigration-tariffs-guests-93f6107ede260854f90c65c4bde60de8) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-speech-congress-doge-ukraine.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/04/trump-speech-second-term-congress/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-address-nation-amid-sagging-approval-ratings/story?id=119390771) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/five-things-to-watch-in-trumps-address-to-congress-d7c833fe))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Senate confirmed Linda McMahon as education secretary, putting her in charge of a department Trump wants to dismantle**. McMahon pledged to make the agency more efficient, but acknowledged that only Congress can shut it down. Trump has already signed orders eliminating diversity programs and transgender student protections while promoting school choice. Trump is considering an executive order to transfer department functions to other agencies. McMahon told staff their "final mission" is to reduce bureaucracy and return education control to the states. Trump said he wants McMahon “to put herself out of a job.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mcmahon-senate-confirmation-education-trump-01b8ff1ea2dac16e3dbeafa7d1014dc3) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/04/linda-mcmahon-education-department-final-mission-00210057) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/linda-mcmahon-confirmed-education))

2. **Trump threatened to revoke federal funding from universities that allow “illegal protests” and vowed to expel, arrest, or deport demonstrators**. Trump did not clarify what makes a protest illegal but stated, “Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came.” Legal experts say such actions would violate the First Amendment. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/trump-college-protests-israel-gaza-funding) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/trump-threatens-funding-for-colleges-allowing-illegal-protests) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/04/trump-students-college-protests-00210193) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/donald-trump-college-funding-protests-f4b5a679))

3. **The CDC sent "disease detectives" to West Texas to help contain a measles outbreak after the state requested federal assistance**. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who initially downplayed the outbreak, acknowledged the outbreak as a "call to action," but stopped short of strongly advocating for vaccination. The Trump administration nevertheless sent 2,000 MMR vaccines and provided lab support to track the virus. The outbreak led to the first U.S. measles-related death in a decade. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/cdc-measles-outbreak.html))

4. **The Senate blocked a Republican bill that would have banned transgender women and girls from competing in female sports**. It failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance. Despite this, the Trump administration is pushing its interpretation of Title IX through an executive order, which directs schools and colleges to bar transgender athletes from women’s sports or risk losing federal funding. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/03/senate-vote-transgender-athletes-womens-sports/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-democrats-block-bill-ban-transgender-athletes-womens-sports-rcna194623) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athletes-congress-dfd81b15ebc09409f1bf6c8642f130f3))

5. **The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against the EPA**, limiting its ability to impose broad water pollution regulations under the Clean Water Act. The case, brought by San Francisco, challenged the EPA’s enforcement of wastewater discharge rules, arguing they were too vague. ([E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/supreme-court-rules-against-epa-in-water-permitting-case/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/supreme-court-epa-water.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/04/supreme-court-san-francisco-epa-sewage-water-pollution/))

6. **A federal judge ruled that Trump unlawfully removed Cathy Harris, chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, and ordered her reinstatement**. Judge Rudolph Contreras found that Trump violated the law by firing Harris without cause, as required by statute. The MSPB protects federal employees from political interference. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-illegally-removed-member-board-protects-government-employees/story?id=119435326) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/politics/cathy-harris-merit-board-fired-trump/index.html))

7. **Trump plans to sell 443 federal properties across 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico**. The buildings, which total nearly 80 million square feet, house federal agencies such as the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs. While not yet officially for sale, the General Services Administration is evaluating offers, including the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston and the Nancy Pelosi Federal Building in San Francisco. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-04/federal-job-cuts-gsa-weighs-selling-properties-in-47-states-dc-puerto-rico))

8. **Trump is hosting $5 million private meetings and $1 million group dinners at Mar-a-Lago**. While funds are reportedly supposed to go toward Trump’s presidential library, ethics experts warn that these high-priced gatherings blur the line between Trump’s presidency and personal business interests. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/people-paying-millions-donald-trump-mar-a-lago/))
