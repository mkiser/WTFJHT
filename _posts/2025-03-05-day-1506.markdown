1/ **Trump delivered a 100-minute address to Congress – the longest in history – and declared his administration’s first 43 days an overwhelming success**. “America is back,” he said, claiming without evidence, “We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations in four or eight years.” Trump promoted his mass federal layoffs, executive actions, and his newly imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, despite market turmoil and warnings that they would raise consumer prices. Although he acknowledged the potential economic fallout, Trump downplayed concerns, saying: “There will be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.”  Trump framed his presidency as a “common-sense revolution,” attacking “wokeness,” endorsing a permanent ban on gender-affirming care for minors, and praising Elon Musk’s leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, saying, “He didn’t need this.” Trump also renewed his push to cut taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits, even though the House-passed budget only allows for an extension of his first-term tax cuts. Meanwhile, his economic claims drew skepticism as stock market losses wiped out post-election gains and consumer confidence dropped. Democrats largely sat in silence, some holding signs reading “Musk Steals” and “False,” while Rep. Al Green was ejected for shouting, “You don’t have a mandate!” Ahead of the speech, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged [restraint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/nancy-pelosi-trump-democrats-congress/), advising Democrats to avoid distractions and instead “let him stew in his own juice.” On foreign policy, Trump defended freezing military aid to Ukraine, reiterated his threats to reclaim the Panama Canal, suggested the U.S. could take control of Greenland, saying "one way or the other we’re going to get it," and blamed Biden for the ongoing war in Gaza, calling him "the worst president in history."

2/ **Sen. Elissa Slotkin, delivering the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s address, warned that his economic policies could "walk us right into a recession."** She accused Trump of prioritizing billionaires over working Americans, saying he is "on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America." She criticized Trump’s tariffs on U.S. allies, arguing they would drive up costs, and called his handling of Ukraine a failure, saying "Reagan must be rolling in his grave." Slotkin also condemned Elon Musk’s influence in government, asking, "Is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns?" Slotkin urged Americans to stay engaged, telling them to "hold your elected officials, including me, accountable."

3/ **Trump granted a one-month exemption from new 25% auto tariffs on Mexico and Canada, following pressure from automakers**. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, said “Reciprocal tariffs will still go into effect on April 2, but at the request of the companies associated with USMCA, the president is giving them an exemption for one month.” The decision came after executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis warned the tariffs would be “devastating” and “blow a hole” in the industry. Trump, meanwhile, spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said “the call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner,” but also accused Trudeau of “trying to use this issue to stay in power.” Despite the temporary reprieve, the United Auto Workers union said it’s in “active negotiations” with the administration to “shape the auto tariffs in April to benefit the working class.” Trump maintains the tariffs are about “making America rich again and making America great again.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/us-weighs-one-month-delay-of-auto-tariffs-on-canada-mexico) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/tariffs-limbo-mixed-messages-meet-wary-markets-rcna194856) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/trump-grants-automakers-one-month-exemption-from-tariffs.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/trump-auto-tariffs-pause-canada-mexico-00213949) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-lutnick-tariffs-reduction-canada-mexico.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-03-05-2025))

4/ **Trump called for ending the $52 billion Chips Act**, arguing that tariffs would be a better way to support U.S. semiconductor manufacturing while generating government revenue. The law has driven over $400 billion in investments from companies like TSMC and Intel, but Trump described it as a “horrible, horrible thing” and urged Congress to repeal it. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program))

5/ **The State Department stopped a global air quality monitoring program "due to budget constraints."** The program, launched in 2008, used sensors at more than 80 embassies and consulates to provide real-time air pollution data, particularly in countries with limited monitoring. While historical data remains available, embassies will no longer transmit live updates unless funding is restored. Experts credit the program with improving global awareness of air pollution, particularly in China, where it helped pressure the government to take action on smog.

poll/ **Trump’s approval rating turned negative for the first time in his second term**. His net approval dropped from +8.3 on Jan. 24 to -0.3 on March 4, with 47.9% disapproving and 47.6% approving. ([FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/))

### ✏️ Notables.


1. **The Trump administration paused intelligence-sharing with Ukraine**, limiting Kyiv’s ability to target Russian forces. The move follows Trump's decision to freeze military aid as part of an effort to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations with Russia. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed the pause and suggested it could be lifted if Ukraine demonstrates commitment to negotiations. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz added that the administration is "reviewing all aspects of this relationship."

2. **The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid payments**, upholding a lower court’s ruling that the funds must be released to USAID contractors for completed work. In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s liberal justices, instructing the lower court to clarify compliance obligations. Justice Samuel Alito, in a dissent joined by three other conservatives, argued that a single judge shouldn’t have the power to compel such payments, calling the decision “stunning.” The aid freeze, imposed by Trump on his first day in office, halted projects worldwide, including medical aid and infrastructure improvements.

3. **The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the USDA to temporarily reinstate nearly 6,000 employees fired by the Trump administration**, finding that their mass termination likely violated federal law. The ruling grants them 45 days of reinstatement while an investigation continues. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5318687/usda-fired-federal-employees-probationary-osc-mspb) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/politics/usda-employees-fired-reinstatement/index.html))

4. **The Trump administration is planning to cut up to 50% of the IRS workforce**, reducing it from about 90,000 employees through layoffs, attrition, and buyouts. So far, 7,000 employees, mostly new hires, have been laid off, with further reductions expected after tax season. The administration is also considering reassigning some IRS employees to assist with immigration enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/irs-doge-layoffs-tax-season-0659e4b439400bf66023273f6a532fa0) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/irs-job-cuts.html))

5. **The Trump administration plans to cut between 70,000 and 80,000 jobs from the Department of Veterans Affairs**. The VA’s chief of staff instructed officials to prepare for an August restructuring aimed at “resizing” the workforce in collaboration with the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency. The VA expanded under Biden, particularly to implement the PACT Act, which expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.

6. **The Trump administration reinstated some CDC employees weeks after firing around 750 staff members**. Emails sent Tuesday informed some workers their termination letters had been rescinded, allowing them to return to work immediately. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5318077/cdc-layoffs-rescinded))

7. **The Trump administration withdrew a plan to sell nearly 80 million square feet of federal property after receiving “overwhelming interest” from buyers**. The General Services Administration initially listed 443 properties, including agency headquarters and historic sites. Within hours, GSA removed 123 properties, and by Wednesday morning, the entire list was taken down. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/federal-properties-sale-list-trump.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-agency-pulls-443-sites-off-market-in-real-estate-reversal))

8. **The Trump administration dropped a Biden-era lawsuit challenging Idaho’s strict abortion ban**, which only allows abortion when a woman’s life is at risk. The Biden administration had argued that federal law required hospitals to provide emergency abortions when necessary to protect a woman’s health.
