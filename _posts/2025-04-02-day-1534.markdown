1/ **Trump imposed a 10% blanket tariff on all U.S. imports and steeper country-specific “reciprocal tariffs” on about 60 countries**, bypassing Congress and invoking emergency powers to justify what he called “economic independence.” China will now face a 54% total tariff, while Vietnam, India, Japan, and the EU face rates between 20% and 46%. Trump claimed the tariffs were a response to “economic warfare” and a $1.2 trillion trade deficit. His use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, typically reserved for sanctions, to enact his policies makes him the first president to use that law to raise tariffs unilaterally. “These tariffs are going to give us growth,” Trump said. Economists across the political spectrum, however, say the tariffs will drive up costs for American consumers and businesses, risk a global trade war, and offer little near-term benefit. “Rather than fixing the rules \[...\] Trump has chosen to blow up the system,” Cornell economist Eswar Prasad said. The White House admitted the rates were “calculated” but then arbitrarily cut them in half, raising questions about the logic behind Trump’s tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged foreign governments, “Don’t retaliate,” while Trump insisted, “This is kind reciprocal.” Mexico and Canada are exempt from the new tariffs for now, but remain under separate 25% duties tied to unrelated fentanyl enforcement. Markets dropped immediately: S&P 500 futures fell over 3%, Nasdaq dropped 4%, and Dow futures slid nearly 1,000 points. Goldman Sachs warned foreign-made cars could cost $15,000 more, with U.S.-assembled vehicles seeing up to $8,000 in added costs due to imported parts. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, fell to a 12-year low, with two-thirds of Americans expecting job losses.

2/ **Trump pressured Senate Republicans to block a resolution that would nullify his emergency declaration used to impose tariffs on Canadian goods**. The Senate vote, expected Wednesday evening, is led by Sen. Tim Kaine and backed by Democrats and at least four Republican senators: Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul. Trump attacked them online, directing voters to “get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values.” The resolution, which needs a simple majority to pass the Senate, wouldn’t advance in the Republican-controlled House, and Trump has vowed to veto it.

3/ **Liberal Judge Susan Crawford won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, defeating conservative Brad Schimel despite $25 million in backing from Elon Musk and support from Trump**. Crawford’s win maintains the court’s 4–3 liberal majority, which will decide on abortion access, labor rights, and redistricting in the coming months. She won by about 10 points, a swing toward Democrats in a state Trump won by one point in November. The race became the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history, with spending exceeding $100 million. “I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world – for justice in Wisconsin – and we won,” Crawford said. Musk had framed the election as one of the most important elections and offered money to voters and canvassers to boost turnout, but Republicans now question whether his presence hurt more than helped. “He made the election about him and they paid the price,” Crawford’s senior adviser said. Meanwhile in Florida, Republicans won two special House elections, but underperformed in both. In the 6th District, Republican Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil by 14 points – less than half Trump’s 30-point margin there in 2024. In the 1st District, Republican Jimmy Patronis won by 15 points in a district Matt Gaetz carried by 32.

4/ **Trump told aides and members of his Cabinet that Elon Musk will soon leave his White House role – likely when his 130-day appointment ends in late May**. Publicly, Trump said, “At some point he’s going to be going back. He wants to,” but inside the West Wing officials said his chaotic presence is wearing thin. “People were so pissed about it, because it’s fucking insane,” said one insider, citing Musk’s rogue decisions, poor coordination, and increasing political damage. Musk’s $21 million gamble on a failed Wisconsin judicial race deepened Republican concerns that he’s become a liability. Despite the denial from Trump’s press team – who called the story “garbage” – they didn’t dispute Musk is leaving. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/02/trump-musk-leaving-political-liability-00265784) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-privately-elon-musk-step-back-current-role/story?id=120415238) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/tesla-shares-rise-on-unconfirmed-report-elon-musk-could-be-leaving-doge-post-soon.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-doge-tesla-government-cuts-c47211544c5382a6207779ee95c6060b) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/teslas-global-vehicle-deliveries-sink-13-in-first-quarter-a1d6c1d4))

5/ **Trump is considering a deal to avoid a TikTok ban that would let China’s ByteDance keep control of the app’s algorithm by leasing it to a U.S. spinoff**. The proposal would likely violate a federal law requiring a full break from foreign ownership, but Trump may certify it anyway. “Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in tariffs,” he said, hinting at [using the deal as leverage](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/26/trump-tariffs-china-tiktok) in trade talks with China. Despite national security concerns, Trump has pushed to “save TikTok,” a platform popular with his base. Amazon also made a last-minute bid, but officials dismissed it, focusing instead on a complex plan backed by U.S. investors that may still leave ByteDance with influence.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Mike Waltz’s national security team created at least 20 Signal group chats to coordinate U.S. policy on crises in Ukraine, China, Gaza, and other regions**. House Democrats opened a probe, citing “deeply alarming concerns” over the potential misuse of unsecured platforms.

2. **The Social Security Administration canceled key contracts with Maine in retaliation against Democratic Gov. Janet Mills**. Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek called Mills a “petulant child” and ordered the cancellations of contracts, which allowed hospitals to enroll newborns in the Social Security system at birth and let parents verify deaths through an electronic system, days after Mills publicly pushed back against Trump’s efforts to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls’ sports. Dudek reinstated them less than 24 hours later. ([HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/janet-mills-social-security-maine-leland-dudek_n_67ed2d99e4b0b937ab8f135c))

([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/doctor-breakthrough-parkinsons-research-nih-purge/))

4. **The FDA missed its April 1 deadline to grant full approval for Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine**, leaving the application in limbo days after vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks resigned. The delay also comes as HHS, now led by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., reviews all vaccine-related messaging. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/fda-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-deadline-c160454b))

6. **The White House is studying what it would cost to acquire Greenland and what the U.S.** could gain from the island’s mineral resources.

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/01/trump-greenland-us-territory-cost/))

7. **Trump’s social media company filed paperwork Wednesday that could allow his trust to sell up to $2.3 billion in Truth Social stock**. Trump, however, said last year he didn’t plan to sell, saying “I don’t need the money.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-truth-social-stock))

8. **A federal judge permanently dismissed the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams**, rejecting the Trump Justice Department’s request to leave the door open to future prosecution. Judge Dale Ho criticized DOJ's claim that dropping the charges would help Adams support Trump’s immigration policies, calling it “unprecedented” and “disturbing.” Adams was indicted last year for bribery and campaign finance violations.
