1/ **China warned it would “fight to the end” and said the U.S. “will never intimidate China” after Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% unless Beijing dropped its 34% retaliatory duties**. China’s Commerce Ministry called the move “a mistake on top of a mistake” and accused the U.S. of “blackmail.” Beijing also denounced JD Vance as “ignorant and impolite” after he claimed Americans were borrowing money from “Chinese peasants” to buy Chinese-made goods. The 104% tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect Wednesday, with no signs that Trump will delay them.

2/ **Trump claimed his tariff policy is working and told aides to start cutting “tailor-made” trade deals with any country that calls**. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that some “very large countries” would make deals soon, while Trump posted that a “great deal” with South Korea was near — but so far, none of the deals have materialized and no further details have been offered. Nevertheless, Trump acknowledged that his tariffs have been “somewhat explosive.” Republicans, however, aren’t convinced. “Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?” Sen. Thom Tillis asked. And, some Republicans are now openly questioning Trump’s strategy and warning of political fallout. “Whether this will have a happy ending or a sad ending depends in large part what President Trump does next,” Sen. John Kennedy said. Meanwhile, the consumer confidence index fell five points in a week to 90.6 — its sharpest drop since Trump took office – and markets continued to fall with the S&P 500 down 18.9% since its mid-February record. One Republican pollster warned that Trump’s policy is “the opposite of what Americans voted for,” and a new poll showed that 55% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy with 58% viewing Trump’s tariffs unfavorably.

3/ **Elon Musk called Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro “truly a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” after Navarro dismissed Tesla as a “car assembler” that relies on foreign parts**. The feud stems from Musk’s opposition to Trump’s new tariffs, which he says will raise costs for consumers and U.S. manufacturers. Musk has pushed for a “zero-tariff” trade deal with Europe, arguing it would reduce trade barriers and promote free-market competition. Navarro, however, rejected the idea, accusing Musk of protecting his own supply chains and “wanting cheap foreign parts.” The White House brushed off the exchange, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying: “Boys will be boys." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/elon-musk-calls-trumps-top-trade-adviser-peter-navarro-moron-dumber-sa-rcna200208) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5235767-elon-musk-trump-tariffs/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-adviser-navarro-dismisses-musk-car-assembler-after-tariff-comments-2025-04-07/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/musk-calls-navarro-a-moron-as-trump-tariff-spat-gets-messy) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/musk-navarro-tariffs-fight.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/musk-navarro-fighting-00277994) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/musk-navarro-moron-trump-tariffs-trade-war) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-trump-tariffs-trade-policy-c9e955d6))

* **Trump has questioned why Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is at the White House so frequently and has grown frustrated with him**. Officials said Lutnick spends more time there than any other cabinet member and often becomes emotional in meetings. His constant presence and behavior have irritated senior aides, who see him as overstepping. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/howard-lutnick-trump-trade-agenda-messaging-75d84e01))

4/ **The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration's firing of 16,000 probationary federal employees to go forward – for now, at least**. In a 7-2 decision, the justices blocked a lower court’s order that required the government to reinstate the workers, ruling that the nonprofit groups behind the lawsuit lacked legal standing. The case focused on employees at six agencies, including Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Treasury, who were dismissed under a Trump order to downsize the federal workforce. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5351799/scotus-probationary-workers) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/08/supreme-court-halts-rehiring-probationary-federal-workers/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-allows-trump-terminate-16000-probationary-federal/story?id=120599910) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-pauses-judges-order-reinstate-federal-probationary-worke-rcna197840) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/trump-federal-workers-firing-supreme-court-00278742) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/supreme-court-probationary-workers.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-mass-firings-02e218d2b7ee59925ddcb597b6b0a4fe))

5/ **The Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to allow the Trump administration to resume deportations under the Alien Enemies Act**, so long as detainees are given a chance to challenge their removal. The court tossed a lower court order that paused the deportations and said migrants must file legal challenges in the jurisdiction where they are held. The ruling, however, doesn’t resolve whether the administration’s use of the 18th-century wartime law against alleged Venezuelan gang members is lawful. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/07/trump-supreme-court-alien-enemies-act-deportations) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-gives-boost-trump-deportation-plans-alien-enemies-act-rcna198585) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/supreme-court-lets-trump-use-wartime-law-to-deport-venezuelans) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/supreme-court-venezuela-gang-alien-enemies-act/))

* **The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s order requiring the Trump administration to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia**, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Chief Justice Roberts issued an administrative stay, pausing the midnight deadline while the court reviews the case. The administration admitted Garcia’s deportation was an “administrative error,” but argued that the courts lack the power to order his return from a foreign government. A federal judge had called the deportation “grievous” and “wholly lawless,” while an appeals court likened it to “official kidnapping.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/politics/supreme-court-el-salvador-abrego-garcia) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/07/abrego-garcia-case-trump-deportation-el-salvador-00276237) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/supreme-court-wrongly-deported.html))

6/ **The Department of Homeland Security canceled legal protections for nearly 1 million people who entered the U.S. using the Biden-era CBP One app**. These migrants had been allowed to stay and work temporarily, but the Trump administration is now telling them to self-deport. Those who don’t comply could be fined $998 per day and permanently barred from returning. Migrants from Ukraine and Afghanistan admitted through separate programs are not affected. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/dhs-parole-revoked-app-00007326) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-admin-revokes-legal-status-migrants-entered-us-biden-era-cbp-one-rcna200177) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5237720-trump-immigration-crackdown-dhs-parole-protections-migrants-biden-cbp-one-app-southern-border/))

7/ **The IRS will share immigrant tax data with ICE to help the Trump administration track and deport undocumented people**. Under a new agreement, ICE can request names and addresses of immigrants who filed taxes using special ID numbers. The deal reverses long-standing IRS policy and has triggered concerns from tax experts and immigrant groups, who say it could be illegal and may deter people from filing taxes out of fear of immigration enforcement. The move could potentially cost the U.S. billions in lost tax revenue. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/08/irs-dhs-tax-data-immigrants/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/irs-ice-immigration-enforcement-trump-d2ac6f7ac0a1f60e907cd3b52d0db34d) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/irs-ice-tax-data-deal.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/irs-agrees-to-share-tax-data-with-immigration-authorities-00278548) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5238271-irs-dhs-immigration-enforcement/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/irs-agrees-to-share-tax-data-on-immigrants-for-criminal-cases))

poll/ **Trump’s approval rating fell to 46% – the lowest point of his second term – and his disapproval crossed above 50% for the first time since his re-election**. Trump’s economic approval dropped to -13, tying his worst-ever rating. 55% of Americans say the economy is getting worse, up from 47% just before the 2024 election, and 58% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s new tariffs, while only 30% approve.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump wants a record $1 trillion defense budget for fiscal year 2026**, calling it “the biggest one we’ve ever done.” The current defense budget is approximately $892 billion. ([Military Times](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/04/08/trump-promises-1-trillion-in-defense-spending-for-next-year/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/07/hegseth-trump-1-trillion-defense-budget-00007147))

2. **Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is allegedly using AI to root out federal employees seen as disloyal to Trump**, according to nearly two dozen sources. At the EPA, Trump appointees told staff that DOGE is scanning chats for “anti-Trump or anti-Musk language” using Musk’s Grok chatbot and other tools. DOGE operatives are also bypassing official document protocols by editing government files live in Google Docs. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/))

3. **Vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called the MMR vaccine “the most effective” way to stop measles** – days after a second unvaccinated child died. But the Health and Human Services Secretary has continued promoting discredited treatments like cod liver oil and vitamin A, while praising doctors who oppose vaccines. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/health/measles-death-texas.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/06/measles-texas-death-outbreak-vaccine/))

4. **Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to direct the CDC to stop recommending water fluoridation**, renewing his claim that fluoride is a “dangerous neurotoxin.” EPA chief Lee Zeldin said  the agency is “ready to act” and will reexamine fluoride risks. The move follows Utah’s new ban on fluoridated water, the first in the country, which Kennedy praised. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2025/04/07/rfk-epa-zeldin-fluoride-drinking-water-ban) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5236857-epa-review-fluoride-health-impacts-drinking-water/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-cdc-epa-6f4dbc64b5dc511f712a82cd2d252d76))
