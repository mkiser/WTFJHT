1/ **Trump suggested that he’ll deport violent U.S. citizens to El Salvador**, a move legal experts called “pretty obviously illegal” and unconstitutional. “If it’s a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,” Trump said, adding, “We’re studying the laws right now.” He claimed the plan would cut costs and boost security, praising El Salvador’s mega-prison and asking President Nayib Bukele to build more. Immigration lawyers said no law allows the government to exile its own citizens, and warned the courts must intervene. “U.S. citizens may not be deported to imprisonment abroad,” said David Bier of the Cato Institute.

* **Trump ordered the Army to take control of a federal border strip, allowing troops to detain migrants on land now treated as a military base**. “The intent is to have troops detain migrants,” an official said. Experts, however, say it likely violates U.S. law. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/border-trump-roosevelt-military-immigration-85974188a51593351eed70ad26291888))

2/ **The Trump administration said it will not return the Maryland resident it deported illegally to El Salvador, arguing the courts have no power to direct U.S. foreign policy**. Despite admitting Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation was an “administrative error” that violated a court order, Attorney General Pam Bondi dismissed responsibility, saying, “That’s not up to us.” Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, sitting next to Trump, rejected the request outright, saying: “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course, I’m not going to do it.” Trump officials have offered no evidence supporting their claims that Abrego Garcia is a gang member, and a 2019 immigration court ruling had barred his deportation. The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return, but stopped short of requiring them to “effectuate” it – leaving the term vague. Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered daily updates on the case, can’t force diplomacy but can demand action, compel transparency, and hold officials in contempt. She is expected to weigh next steps Tuesday.

3/ **A U.S. immigration judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil – a legal permanent resident and former Columbia student protest leader – can be deported after the Trump administration labeled him a foreign policy threat**. The judge, Jamee Comans, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s two-page memo was “facially reasonable” and declined to hear arguments about its accuracy, saying “This court is neither inclined or authorized” to question Rubio. Khalil’s lawyers said the hearing lacked “fundamental fairness” and called the process a “charade of due process.” Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, told the court: “This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family."

4/ **The State Department found no evidence linking a Tufts Ph.D. student to terrorism or antisemitism before ICE agents detained her**, according to an internal memo. The memo said DHS failed to justify its claim that Rumeysa Ozturk supported Hamas. Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked her visa under a separate immigration rule that requires no evidence or explanation. “This was done to chill her speech,” Ozturk’s lawyer told a federal judge. Ozturk, unaware her visa was revoked, was arrested by masked agents, shackled, and flown to a Louisiana detention center. A judge in Vermont is now weighing if her detention violates the Constitution ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/13/tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-rubio-trump/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-student-ice-hearing-jurisdiction/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5247772-state-antisemitism-terrorism-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-rubio-dhs/))

5/ **Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one day after a Russian missile strike killed at least 35 civilians in Sumy**. “Everybody’s to blame,” Trump said, listing Zelensky alongside Putin and Biden. “If Biden were competent and if Zelensky were competent [...] that war should have never been allowed to happen. [...] You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size.” Trump made the remarks after downplaying the Sumy missile strike as a “mistake” by Russia. Zelensky, meanwhile, rejected Trump’s claim that Ukraine started the war, and invited Trump to visit Ukraine to see the damage firsthand, saying: “Come, look, and then let’s move with a plan on how to finish the war."([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-missile-strike-ukraines-sumy-kills-mayor/story?id=120759230) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/14/trump-ukraine-russia-war-00289352) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/14/trump-blames-zelensky-russia-ukraine-war-ceasefire) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/14/trump-presidency-news-tariffs-deportations/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/world/europe/trump-ukraine-sumy-russia-attack.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-jab-jd-vance-justify-russia-war-ukraine/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/14/zelensky-trump-vance-russia-ukraine-war-60-minutes))

6/ **Trump temporarily exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from his new 125% tariff on Chinese imports, but said that those products will soon face separate, sector-specific tariffs**. “They’re just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket,’” Trump posted, adding the administration is “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.”  The carve-out spared roughly $390 billion in goods from the “reciprocal” tariffs, but marked what Trump called a “procedural” step. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” he said. The new levies are expected to be issued under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, making them harder to reverse than the broader country-based tariffs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the tariffs will be reimposed within one to two months under a national security review. Trump also said he may delay auto part tariffs to give carmakers more time to source components domestically. “They need a little bit of time,” Trump said. “They’re going to make them here.” Pharmaceuticals will be targeted next, with Lutnick and other officials saying the goal is to reshore critical manufacturing. As markets continue to swing, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett downplayed recession fears, insisting “100% not” happening. Meanwhile, Democrats called for SEC investigations into possible insider trading after Trump’s abrupt tariff pause sent markets soaring last week.

"Beijing has suspended exports of certain rare earth minerals and magnets that are crucial for the world’s car, semiconductor and aerospace industries." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html))

7/ **Consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 in April** – the second-lowest reading since the University of Michigan began tracking it in 1952. The drop followed a spike in inflation fears, with short-term expectations jumping to 6.7% – the highest since 1981. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/consumer-sentiment-tumbles-in-april-as-inflation-fears-spike-university-of-michigan-survey-shows.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumer-confidence-sinks-further-umich-says-c3c09654) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/consumer-sentiment-report-plunge-april-michigan-trump-tariffs/))

poll/ **44% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the economy and 40% approved of his handling of inflation – both down 4 points since late March**. 75% said tariffs will increase prices in the short term, and 48% expect a long-term effect. 58% said his policies are driving up prices, and 49% said they are making them financially worse off. Despite this, 91% of Republicans said Trump has a clear trade plan, though only 16% of Democrats and 43% of independents agreed.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration proposed dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate and weather research programs**. The plan would eliminate NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, cut the agency’s budget by over 27%, and limit dozens of research and regulatory programs tied to climate, fisheries, satellites, and coastal protection. It would also shift parts of NOAA’s mission to other departments, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department, and redirect remaining efforts toward supporting fossil fuel development. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/climate/trump-noaa-budget-cuts) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/nx-s1-5361366/major-budget-cuts-proposed-for-the-national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/white-house-plan-guts-noaa-climate-research-00286408) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/climate/noaa-research-budget-cuts.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/14/nasas-climate-funding-in-jeopardy-with-potential-cuts))

2. **The Trump administration proposed cutting the State Department and USAID budget by 48%**. The plan would eliminate nearly all funding for humanitarian aid, global health programs, and international organizations including the U.N. and NATO. It would shut down the Fulbright Program, end peacekeeping support, close offices, and lay off thousands of employees. Some funding would be redirected into a new $2.1 billion “America First Opportunities Fund.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/14/state-department-budget-cuts-trump-rubio/))

3. **The Trump administration wants to make $9 billion in immediate cuts to NPR, PBS, and foreign aid**. The plan ends all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and cancels foreign aid grants managed by USAID. It also eliminates smaller agencies like the U.S. Institute of Peace. The package will go to Congress on April 28, triggering a 45-day period where the White House can legally withhold the funds. Trump argues the funds contradict his agenda and rejects the 1974 law requiring the president to spend money already approved by Congress. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/trump-targets-npr-pbs-foreign-aid-in-9-billion-spending-cut))

4. **Trump demanded that the FCC revoke CBS’s license and fine the network after 60 Minutes aired two segments criticizing him**. He called the reporting “illegal” and said CBS should “pay a big price.” The segments featured Ukraine’s president and Greenland officials speaking negatively about Trump. The demand follows Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS over a 2024 interview with Kamala Harris. CBS denied wrongdoing and said the suit is an attack on press freedom. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cbs-60-minutes-2c8a32df63f3ec50cfffe94a26436fda) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/media/5247488-trump-says-cbs-should-lose-license-after-60-minutes-segments-on-ukraine-greenland/) / [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/politics/news/trump-honored-sue-60-minutes-cbs-urges-fcc-maximum-fines-1236368760/) / [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/04/14/donald-trump-fcc-chair-paramount-cbs-60minutes/))

5. **Harvard rejected the Trump administration’s demand to overhaul its governance in exchange for $9 billion in federal funding**. The White House ordered the university to shut down diversity programs, report foreign students to federal authorities, and submit to ideological audits. Harvard called the demands unconstitutional and refused to comply. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-rejects-trump-administration-demands-threats-funding-cuts-rcna201203) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-rejects-policy-changes/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/harvard-rejects-proposed-agreement-with-trump-administration))

6. **The Pentagon fired Col. Susannah Meyers for rejecting JD Vance’s remarks supporting U.S. annexation of Greenland**. Meyers emailed base staff saying Vance’s comments did not reflect Pituffik Space Base leadership. The Pentagon said actions that “subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated.” ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creq99l218do) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/us-military-fires-commander-susannah-meyers-greenland-base-critic-jd-vance-visit/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/greenland-commander-fired-vance-space-force-48d542d1b6adc5e920b45b252de3a7d0) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/greenland-pituffik-vance-military-commander.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-fires-commander-of-greenland-base-that-vance-visited-7f7d4089))

7. **A Pennsylvania man broke into Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home and set it on fire while the governor and his family were inside**. The suspect, Cody Balmer, told police he intended to kill Shapiro with a hammer. He used gasoline-filled beer bottles to start the fire and fled the scene before turning himself in. Shapiro’s family escaped unharmed. Balmer faces multiple charges, including attempted murder and terrorism. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/14/cody-balmer-josh-shapiro-arson-fire-pennsylvania/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/josh-shapiro-arson-charges-pennsylvania-governor-c3ccfc0f23a40f2b10bd6ba767d53f80) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/us/pennsylvania-governor-arson-what-we-know-hnk/index.html))

8. **Trump claimed he “got every answer right” on a cognitive test during his annual physical exam but couldn’t recall the test’s name**. “It’s a pretty well-known test. Whatever it is,” he said aboard Air Force One. The White House physician declared Trump “fully fit” and in “excellent cognitive and physical health,” citing “frequent victories in golf events” as supporting evidence. Trump, 78, is the oldest president to begin a second term. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/nx-s1-5361249/trump-physical-cognitive-test) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/13/trump-physical-exam-results/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/politics/trumps-health-report/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-12/trump-says-he-aced-a-cognitive-test-during-physical-exam) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-cant-recall-the-details-of-his-favorite-cognitive-test/))
