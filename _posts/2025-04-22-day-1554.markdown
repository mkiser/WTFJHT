1/ **Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared real-time strike details from a secure military channel in two private Signal chats less than 10 minutes after receiving them**. The information — launch and target times for U.S. airstrikes on Houthi forces in Yemen — came from Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, via a classified system. Despite prior warnings from aides not to use unsecured apps for sensitive material, Hegseth forwarded parts of that data to Signal groups that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. He denied sharing classified information, calling the messages “informal, unclassified coordinations.” The Pentagon inspector general has launched an investigation, while Hegseth has blamed “disgruntled former staff” for leaking the story. Trump has also defended him, calling the reports “fake news,” while the White House claims Hegseth is being targeted because he’s “changing the Pentagon.” Republican Rep. Don Bacon called Hegseth’s conduct “totally unacceptable.” And, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said:“It is unheard of \[...\] That is the most classified information you can have.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/info-pete-hegseth-shared-wife-brother-came-top-generals-secure-message-rcna198838) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hegseth-lashes-alleged-pentagon-leakers-claims-sabotage-trumps/story?id=121044112) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5260944-defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-signal/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/pete-hegseth-leaks-investigation-00302506) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-leaks-signal-trump-classified-09f58fa650e44f740c9416c3e6997f5b) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/22/hegseth-signal-leakers-report/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/hegseth-says-leakers-want-to-sabotage-trumps-agenda-72d4b07c) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/hegseth-chaos-pentagon.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/21/leavitt-trump-stands-strongly-behind-embattled-hegseth-00300749))

2/ **Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a major reorganization of the State Department that will cut 700 jobs, shut down 132 offices, and eliminate several human rights and democracy programs**. The plan, posted online with little detail, targets offices Rubio called “platforms for left-wing activists” and shifts refugee and war crimes work to a new foreign aid office. Rubio claimed the department had become “bloated” and misaligned with U.S. interests. Officials said no one was fired immediately, but internal memos confirmed layoffs and embassy closures are likely. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/state-department-rubio-reorganization-trump-usaid-3fc186fefddaaa72c3040db9fb380af4) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/marco-rubio-state-department-overhaul) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/state-department-cuts-rubio.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/22/trump-rubio-state-department-reorganization/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/state-department-reorganization-marco-rubio-human-rights) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/politics/rubio-state-department-cuts/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/rubio-unveils-state-department-overhaul-to-promote-trumps-america-first-policies-1a593705))

* **Interior Secretary Doug Burgum gave a former oil executive and aide to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency authority to overhaul the Department of the Interior**. Tyler Hassen, who is not Senate-confirmed, now controls major functions including grants, contracts, personnel systems, and communications. Internal emails show DOGE aides demanded lists of grants to cut, including millions directed to Maine, as Trump threatened to defund the state over LGBTQ\+ policies. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/21/tyler-hassen-department-of-interior/))

3/ **The EPA will lay off 280 employees and reassign 175 others from its environmental justice and civil rights offices**. The agency gave no evidence to support its claim that the cuts would “advance the EPA’s core mission.” The move removes staff focused on protecting pollution-burdened communities and shuts down programs tied to equity. “Announcing a RIF of the EJ program on the eve of Earth Day is sick,” one employee said. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/22/epa-staff-cuts-environmental-justice-dei/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/epa-starts-layoffs-environmental-justice-employees-rcna202287) / [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/epa-will-cut-environmental-justice-workers-in-july-staff-told))

4/ **Lawmakers in both parties are moving to protect the Federal Reserve’s independence as Trump escalates attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and positions him as the scapegoat for slowing economic growth due his trade war**. Rep. Frank Lucas, who leads a congressional Fed oversight panel, said there's “bipartisan interest” in building “stronger and taller” guardrails to keep politics out of monetary policy. Trump previously accused Powell of cutting rates to help Biden win in 2024 and warned that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Days later Trump claimed he has “no intention” of firing Powell before his term ends next year. “Never did.” He added: “We think that it’s a perfect time to lower the rate, and we’d like to see our chairman be early or on time, as opposed to late." Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund slashed its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8%, down from 2.7%, citing Trump’s trade war for fueling uncertainty and inflation.

5/ **Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump’s trade war with China is unsustainable and suggested that “there will be a de-escalation” soon**, though he admitted no talks have begun. Bessent called the standoff a “two-way embargo” and warned that negotiations with Beijing will be “a slog.” He also said a full deal could take “two to three years” and would require a “rebalancing” that boosts U.S. manufacturing. The U.S. currently imposes 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs. Markets jumped on the remarks, despite the lack of concrete steps or confirmed talks between Trump and Xi. Nevertheless, the White House claimed that Trump is “setting the stage for a deal with China.”  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/bessent-sees-de-escalation-with-china-situation-unsustainable) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/bessent-trump-tariffs-china-deescalate.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariffs-stocks-gold-price.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-china-trade-deal-tariffs) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/bessent-sees-de-escalation-us-china-trade-tensions-talks-be-a-slog-2025-04-22/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5261149-white-house-donald-trump-trade-negotiations-china/))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration will restart collections on defaulted federal student loans beginning May 5**, ending a five-year pause started during the pandemic. More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default and millions more nearing it. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their loans. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5371723/trump-administration-collections-on-defaulted-student-loans) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/student-loan-debt-default-collection-fa6498bf519e0d50f2cd80166faef32a))

2. **Harvard sued the Trump administration after the federal government froze $2.2 billion in research funding and demanded oversight of the university**. The lawsuit accuses the administration of violating the First Amendment, attempting “unprecedented and improper control,” and claimed the government failed to justify its actions with a clear link to antisemitism concerns. The administration had ordered Harvard to audit faculty, monitor international students, and appoint an outside overseer. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/harvard-lawsuit-trump-administration.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/21/harvard-sues-trump) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sues-trump-administration-funding-rcna202276))

3. **ICE denied Mahmoud Khalil temporary release to attend the birth of his first child**. The Columbia University graduate, a legal U.S. resident and pro-Palestinian activist, has been held in ICE custody since March after a judge ruled he could be deported over national security concerns. He has not been charged with a crime, but the Trump administration claims his presence threatens U.S. foreign policy. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mahmoud-khalil-columbian-palestinians-detention-wife-birth-1716cc67d55f4001e4972f35dd18749e) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/us/mahmoud-khalil-denied-ice-release-son-birth/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/mahmoud-khalil-baby-ice-detention))

4. **ICE detained Harvard scientist Kseniia Petrova, stopping her work on a breakthrough microscope that could advance early cancer detection**. Petrova, a Russian-born specialist in image analysis, was arrested in February at a Boston airport for failing to declare frog embryo samples and now faces possible deportation. Petrova, who opposes the war in Ukraine, said she fears persecution if sent back to Russia. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detain-kseniia-petrova-protest-harvard-cancer-research-rcna202180))

5. **A Venezuelan immigrant disappeared after being detained by U.S. immigration authorities and deported in March**. Ricardo Prada Vásquez mistakenly crossed into Canada and was arrested trying to return to the U.S., then transferred between detention centers before vanishing from government records. Although ICE confirmed his deportation, officials have not disclosed where he was sent, and his name does not appear on flight or detention rosters. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/venezuela-immigrant-disappear-deport-ice.html))

6. **Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of failing to comply with a court order requiring officials to testify about his wrongful deportation to El Salvador**. A federal judge had previously ruled that Abrego Garcia must be returned to the U.S., a decision later affirmed by the Supreme Court. His lawyers, however, say the administration has provided no meaningful information and is hiding behind baseless claims of privilege. Meanwhile, top Trump adviser Stephen Miller reversed earlier acknowledgments of an “administrative error,” claiming Abrego Garcia was deported appropriately. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/abrego-garcias-attorneys-decry-administrations-failure-comply-court/story?id=121046788) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/abrego-garcia-trump-deportations-el-salvador.html))

7. **The Justice Department granted DOGE access to a sensitive immigration database, which contains private records of millions of immigrants**.The system includes names, addresses, legal history, and asylum testimony typically restricted to legal representatives. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/21/doge-ecas-justice-immigration-courts-trump/))

8. **More than 500 political scientists warn that the U.S. is rapidly shifting toward authoritarianism under Trump’s second term**. Scholars rate the performance of American democracy on a scale from zero (complete dictatorship) to 100 (perfect democracy). Trump's second term currently sits at 55 due, in part, to expanded executive power, attacks on media and universities, and efforts to punish political opponents. Meanwhile, more than 150 university presidents condemned the administration’s funding threats and political interference in higher education. The White House, however, dismissed the letter, saying it would not be “swayed by worthless letters by overpaid blowhards.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/150-college-presidents-sign-letter-rebuking-government-overreach-rcna202318))

9. **Al Gore compared Trump’s use of executive power to early Nazi Germany**. Gore warned that Trump's administration is “creating their own preferred version of reality” and cited philosopher Theodor Adorno’s analysis of fascist regimes. He accused Trump of stalling clean energy progress and spreading falsehoods about climate change. The White House dismissed Gore’s remarks, saying: “Those who yell the loudest about Nazis are often times using their same tactics themselves.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/al-gore-likens-trump-administrations-attacks-liberty-nazi-germany-rcna202357) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/al-gore-trump-nazi-germany) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/al-gore-compares-trump-administration-to-third-reich-hitler-00302348))
