1/ **A federal judge blocked part of Trump’s executive order that would have required people to prove their citizenship to register to vote in federal elections**. For now, the Election Assistance Commission can’t change the form to require documents like a passport or birth certificate. Trump’s order tried to sidestep Congress by pushing through parts of the SAVE Act, pending legislation that would mandate proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. The House passed it earlier this month, but it faces opposition in the Senate. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote, “No statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress’s deliberative process by executive order.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-elections-executive-order-citizenship-lawsuit-4b683fe2e1106316fdb05621be9b7d0e) / [NPR](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-requiring-proof-citizenship-register/story?id=121134512) / [Washington Post](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-requiring-proof-citizenship-register/story?id=121134512) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-blocks-trump-administration-requiring-proof-citizenship-register/story?id=121134512) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/politics/judge-blocks-trump-proof-of-citizenship-voter-registration/index.html))

2/ **Trump will direct the Justice Department to investigate the Democrats’ main online fundraising platform**. The memo cites a House Republican report that found 237 donations to ActBlue made using foreign IP addresses and prepaid cards during a 30-day window in the 2024 cycle. The report also identified 22 major fraud campaigns – nearly half with foreign ties – and criticized ActBlue’s internal instability and weak fraud prevention. ActBlue called the move “politically motivated” and said it complies with all laws. The memo, however, doesn’t mention WinRed, the Republican’s fundraising platform, which has faced its own scrutiny, including reports of recurring donations being processed without clear user consent and allegations of donor confusion over pre-checked boxes. ActBlue CEO Regina Wallace-Jones called the selective enforcement "the next version of 'the big lie.’" ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-expected-sign-memo-targeting-act-blue-rcna202673) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/trump-to-target-actblue-in-presidential-memorandum-00307251) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-takes-aim-at-democratic-fundraising-apparatus-6afddedb) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-actblue-democrats.html))

3/ **Two federal judges blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that threatened to cut federal funding from schools with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs**. Judge Landya McCafferty called the Education Department’s directive “textbook viewpoint discrimination” and said it forced educators into “a Hobson’s Choice” between teaching honestly or risking penalties. She added: “The Constitution requires more.” In a separate case, Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the government “likely did not follow the procedures it should have” and emphasized that “This case is about procedure.” Both judges criticized the policy’s lack of clarity, noting that the Education Department "does not even define what a ‘DEI program’ is.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/24/judge-pause-dei-ban-k-12-schools-trump-doe) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-public-schools-diversity-equality-inclusion-dei-7d7ad707d91565753263a19ebde044e0) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/trump-public-school-funds-dei.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/politics/education-dei-policy-blocked/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-partially-blocks-trumps-effort-ban-dei-12/story?id=121131844))

4/ **Trump signed an executive order to overhaul the role of college accreditors to eliminate “ideological overreach” and to increase “intellectual diversity” on campus**. Accreditors are the private organizations that determine whether universities meet certain standards required to access more than $120 billion in federal education funding each year. Trump accused accreditors of enforcing liberal ideology, calling accreditation his “secret weapon” and claiming they “have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs.” The order directs the Education Department to make it easier for colleges to switch accreditors and for new accreditors to gain federal recognition. It also allows the government to monitor or revoke approval from accreditors that use diversity-based practices. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5263841-trump-executive-order-college-accreditation-mcmahon/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/trump-orders-schools-colleges-funding-accreditors-00307055) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5374365/trump-signs-education-executive-actions) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-executive-order-university-accreditors.html))

5/ **Trump asked the Supreme Court to let the Pentagon enforce his ban on transgender troops**. Judge Benjamin Settle said the government offered “no evidence” the ban improves military readiness. The Trump administration, meanwhile, claimed the courts should defer to the Pentagon and accused Settle of overstepping. The policy blocks service for those with gender dysphoria or who have transitioned, reversing Biden-era rules. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trump-administration-supreme-court-allow-transgender-military-ban-rcna202814) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-allow-enforcement-transgender-military-ban-2025-04-24/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/trump-supreme-court-transgender-troop-ban-00307892) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-supreme-transgender-troops.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-asks-supreme-court-lift-block-transgender-military/story?id=121126776) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-transgender-military-ban-supreme-court/))

6/ **Trump called on Putin to "STOP!" after Russia launched a massive airstrike on Kyiv that at least 12 and injured 90** – the deadliest attack on Ukraine’s capital in nearly a year. “Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump posted, hours after [blaming](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2025/04/23/day-1555/#5-trump-blamed-ukrainian-president-v) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not accepting a U.S. peace plan that would give Russia Crimea and block Ukraine from joining NATO. Trump is pushing for Ukraine to accept the deal in exchange for vague security guarantees. When asked if he would impose new sanctions on Russia, Trump said, “I want to see if we can have a deal,” but offered no timeline for action. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5374877/russia-kyiv-attacks-ukraine-zelenskyy-putin-trump) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-fb61625d2dee8b1917bb3522e73c2166) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/ukraine-kyiv-russia-attack.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/europe/russia-strikes-kyiv-trump-zelensky-crimea-intl-hnk/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/trump-ukraine-deal-norwegian-leaders-00307891) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/24/trump-putin-stop-attack-kiev) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/24/ukraine-war-russia-missile-drone-attack-kyiv/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-launches-massive-deadly-strike-kyiv-ukrainian-authorities/story?id=121113739) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-kyiv-kharkiv-war-peace-crimea-rcna202736) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/us-to-demand-putin-accept-ukraine-s-right-to-military-force) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/russian-strikes-on-kyiv-kill-nine-as-ukraine-peace-talks-stall-70eef6fe))

poll/ **33% of Americans said they’ve heard the false claim that the MMR vaccine is more dangerous than measles – up 15 points since March 2024**. 61% said they’ve heard the debunked theory linking the vaccine to autism. A separate poll found 22% believe vaccines cause autism, including 38% of Trump voters. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/more-americans-exposed-false-claims-about-measles-its-vaccines-kff-poll-shows-2025-04-23/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5265383-vaccines-autism-poll-rfk-trump-kennedy-hhs-cdc/))

* **Measles, once considered “eliminated” in the U.S., could infect millions in the U.S. over the next 25 years if childhood vaccination rates drop by 10%**. The U.S. has reported about 800 measles cases in 2025 so far, including three child deaths. Researchers said a 5% boost in vaccination rates could prevent a widespread resurgence. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/))

poll/ **44% of Americans in a Fox News poll approve of the job Trump is doing as president at the 100-day mark** — down 1 point from his 45% approval at the same point in 2017. It’s the lowest 100-day approval rating ever recorded by the poll, trailing Biden (54%), Obama (62%), and George W. Bush (63%). ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-first-100-days-president-trumps-second-term))

* **Trump attacked Fox News after its latest poll showed his job approval 11 points underwater**, writing: “Rupert Murdoch has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so.” He added, “This ‘pollster’ has gotten me, and MAGA, wrong for years.” Trump also took aim at The Wall Street Journal, saying Murdoch “should start making changes at the China Loving Wall Street Journal. It sucks!!!” ([Variety](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-rupert-murdoch-fox-news-poll-record-low-approval-1236377066/) / [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/trump-fox-news-poll-1236376132/) / [Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/news/it-sucks-trump-bitterly-rages-against-fox-news-and-calls-for-heads-to-roll-at-the-wall-street-journal-in-truth-social-tirade/))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump claimed that the U.S. and China were “actively” discussing a trade deal, but Beijing denied any negotiations were taking place**. “China and the U.S. have not engaged in any consultations or negotiations regarding tariffs,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said. Despite Trump’s suggestion that his 145% tariff rate may drop, the White House insisted there would be “no unilateral reduction.” Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave another conflicting account, saying “both sides are waiting to speak to the other.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/24/china-trump-tariffs) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tariff-trade-war-china-beijing-trump-washington-us-economy-markets-rcna202535) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/pboc-s-pan-warns-trade-frictions-threaten-trust-in-world-economy))

2. **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to bring back a second Venezuelan man it deported to El Salvador in violation of a previous court-approved settlement**. The man, known as Cristian in court documents, was part of a class of asylum-seeking minors protected from removal while their claims were pending. Judge Stephanie Gallagher said the deportation breached a binding agreement and rejected the administration’s claim that invoking the Alien Enemies Act voided those protections. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-orders-return-2nd-migrant-deported-el-salvador/story?id=121110233) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/trump-el-salvador-deportation-venezuelan-minor-judge-00307336) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/24/el-salvador-venezuelan-migrant-asylum/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportation-settlement-el-salvador-d0cf8dbc3c4a5c8dae70b47154e6a1ab) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/deported-migrant-el-salvador-trump.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-administration-must-seek-to-return-another-wrongly-deported-man-judge-rules-ccdfed29))

3. **A federal judge blocked Trump’s latest attempt to cut off funding to sanctuary cities**, calling the move unconstitutional and nearly identical to a failed effort from his first term. U.S. District Judge William Orrick said Trump’s 2025 executive orders violated the separation of powers and due process, writing: “Here we are again.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-sanctuary-cities-immigrants-san-francisco-b20f3c9f44e81e2c2cbc248236762ac4) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/24/federal-judge-blocks-trump-withholding-funds-sanctuary-cities/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-blocks-trump-bid-halt-federal-funding-sanctuary-cities-rcna202828))

4. **Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the encrypted messaging app Signal installed on his Pentagon office computer**, allowing him to bypass cellphone restrictions in secure areas and to communicate freely, including with non-government contacts. Separately, Hegseth reportedly threatened Adm. Christopher Grady, the then-acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that “I’ll hook you up to a fucking polygraph!” after news leaked he was planning a classified briefing for Elon Musk about China. Hegseth demanded proof that Grady hadn’t leaked the news, and Grady was never subjected to a polygraph. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/hegseth-signal-pentagon.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/23/hegseth-signal-pentagon-computer/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pete-hegseth-pentagon-fired-aides-cfa9e0d5))

5. **Trump rejected raising taxes on millionaires**, killing a Republican effort to offset the cost of Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax-cut agenda. “Millionaires would leave the country,” Trump claimed, calling the idea “very disruptive.” House Speaker Mike Johnson added that Republicans “stands against that traditionally.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/johnson-doesnt-expect-tax-hike-on-wealthy-in-gop-budget-plan-00306708) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-speaker-mike-johnson-pour-cold-water-millionaire-tax-hike-rcna202786) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/23/trump-rejects-raising-taxes-millionaires/83239268007/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-millionaire-tax-would-push-wealthy-to-leave-the-us))
