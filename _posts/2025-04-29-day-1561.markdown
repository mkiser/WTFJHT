1/ **Amazon denied it would post tariff-related price hikes after the White House called the reported plan a “hostile and political act.”** Trump called Jeff Bezos following a report that Amazon would show how much Trump’s new tariffs added to product prices, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt asking: “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Amazon said the idea was briefly discussed for its low-cost Haul platform, but claimed it was “never approved” and “not going to happen.” About 900 products on Amazon have risen 29% on average since April 9. Trump later said Bezos "solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. Good guy."

* **Retailers Fear Toy Shortages at Christmas as Tariffs Freeze Supply Chain**. Toy makers and stores are freezing holiday orders, predicting shortages and higher prices. Some are consulting bankruptcy lawyers, fearing their firms won’t survive. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-christmas-china.html))

2/ **Trump retreated on parts of his auto tariffs after automakers warned the levies would wreck supply chains, spike prices, and undercut U.S. jobs**. The White House said automakers paying the 25% tariff will avoid extra charges on steel and aluminum and can apply for partial rebates worth up to 3.75% of a car’s value. Trump framed the move as “a little bit of help,” but the relief followed weeks of heavy lobbying from Ford, GM, and Stellantis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, claimed the changes would let companies “create as many jobs as possible,” though analysts said prices will still rise and long-term supply chain disruptions are unavoidable.

3/ **House Republicans blocked Democrats' attempt to investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of an unsecured messaging app to discuss military plans**. Republican leaders buried language into a procedural measure that prevents votes on such inquiries until at least October. The move also froze over a dozen other Democratic resolutions seeking information on Trump administration actions, including cuts to federal agencies. All Republicans voted for the measure, while all Democrats opposed it. Democrats accused Republicans of "preemptively ceding" Congress’s oversight powers to shield Trump and said Republicans were "closing off" ways to demand accountability.

4/ **The Trump administration dismissed all 400 scientists and experts working on the next National Climate Assessment**, cutting the congressionally mandated report off from its authors. The report guides federal, state, and local decisions on infrastructure, public health, and climate resilience. An email to researchers said, “We are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles,” and claimed the report’s scope was under review. The dismissal halts work on the 2028 assessment and leaves its future uncertain.

5/ **U.S. consumer confidence fell for the fifth straight month to its lowest point since May 2020**, as Trump’s tariffs fueled fears of rising prices and recession. The Conference Board said its index dropped 7.9 points in April to 86, with a key measure falling below recession warning levels. Nearly one-third of consumers expect hiring to slow, matching levels last seen during the Great Recession. Mentions of tariffs in survey responses hit a record high, and nearly 70% of Americans said Trump’s tariffs would push inflation higher.
