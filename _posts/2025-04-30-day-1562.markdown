1/ **The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025 as Trump’s tariffs triggered a surge in imports and dragged down growth**. The Commerce Department said the decline was “primarily” driven by a 41% jump in imports, as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of the new tariffs. That trade imbalance subtracted nearly five percentage points from GDP – the largest hit from net exports since records began in 1947. Consumer spending rose just 1.8% – less than half the pace of the previous quarter – while federal spending fell 5.1%. The stock market logged its worst start to a presidency in more than 50 years, and consumer confidence dropped for the fifth straight month.

2/ **Trump blamed Biden for the U.S. economy’s first quarterly contraction in three years, saying: “This is Biden. That’s not Trump.”** He dismissed any connection to his own policies: “This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS,” and asked Americans to “give us a pass on the first month.” Trump also preemptively blamed the second quarter on Biden, saying, “You could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden.” He promised a future boom “like no other,” even as hiring slowed and markets tumbled.

3/ **Trump suggested that American kids may have to live with “two dolls instead of 30” as his tariffs on China drive up prices and limit imports**. “Maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more,” he added, brushing off concerns about product shortages. Retailers, however, have warned of empty shelves and rising costs ahead of the holidays. Trump, nevertheless, dismissed concerns: “Much of it we don't need.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/trump-china-tariffs-toy-shortage-christmas-2025) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-trade-war-empty-store-shelves_n_68126402e4b0232e1516fde3) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/30/trump-china-tariffs-toys/83372961007/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-tariffs-gdp-7494825851dcef94ec81475124f9326f) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-kids-may-have-fewer-dolls-higher-prices-trade-policies/) / [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-china-tariffs-fewer-dolls-us-children-2025-4))

4/ **Trump told the U.S. Court of International Trade that judges have no authority to question his use of emergency powers to impose tariffs**, claiming only Congress can review such decisions. The Justice Department argued courts shouldn’t “second-guess the president’s judgment,” even as small businesses called the national emergency “a figment of his own imagination.” The Senate, meanwhile, is preparing to vote on a resolution to block Trump’s tariffs, with Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski backing the effort. Collins said the tariffs are “too broad” and supported the disapproval “to send a message.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, dismissed immediate congressional action, but warned that if power between branches becomes “imbalanced,” lawmakers may need to step in.

5/ **A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi, who was detained by ICE during his citizenship interview**. “Even another day of detention is not to be tolerated,” Judge Geoffrey Crawford said, comparing the government’s actions to the McCarthy-era Red Scare. Mahdawi, a green-card holder and pro-Palestinian protest organizer, was targeted under a rarely invoked immigration clause that labels dissenters as foreign policy threats. “To President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said after walking free. Still, DHS defended the arrest, claiming Mahdawi supported terrorists and antisemitic violence, but offered no charges and relied on disputed, years-old allegations.

6/ **Trump said he “could” bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador but won’t**, claiming Garcia “is not” the innocent man his supporters say he is. The statement came in an ABC interview where Trump admitted he has the power to act – “There’s a phone on this desk \[...\] I could” – but blamed unnamed lawyers for blocking it: “I’m not the one making this decision.” Trump’s remarks directly undercut his administration’s legal claim that it lacks authority to return Garcia, despite a Supreme Court order requiring it to “facilitate” his return. Trump also defended sharing a photo of Garcia’s tattooed hands labeled with “MS-13,” which experts say was digitally altered, saying: “He had MS as clear as you can be.” Federal judges have accused the administration of acting in bad faith and “spurning” court orders, with one writing, “This should be shocking \[...\] to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans \[...\] still hold dear.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-deported.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/us/trump-could-bring-abrego-garcia-back-us-hnk/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5274438-donald-trump-abc-news-interview-kilmar-abrego-garcia/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/trump-abc-interview-abrego-garca-detained-el-salvador) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/abrego-garcia-judge-says-us-must-answer-questions-on-his-return) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/trump-interview-ms-13-tattoo-kilmar-abrego-garcia-39b994fa) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-claims-kilmar-abrego-garcia-returned-us-administration-said-othe-rcna203734))
