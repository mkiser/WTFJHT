1/ **Trump said he doesn’t know if he’s required to uphold the Constitution as president, saying, “I don’t know. I’m not a lawyer.”** Despite the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment says that “no person” shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” Trump accused the courts of blocking his efforts to remove “some of the worst people on Earth. I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it.” When asked on whether due process applies to everyone in the U.S., Trump replied that “It might say that,” but added: “We’d have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials.” Trump also dismissed the 9-0 Supreme Court ruling ordering the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, saying Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department “don’t view it that way at all.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-asked-uphold-constitution-says-dont-know-rcna204580) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-due-process-canada-greenland-military-action-8da3e853b6cec944ec373fae4d317ac4) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-i-dont-know-when-asked-if-he-must-uphold-the-constitution-da6fd937) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/04/i-dont-know-trump-constitution-00326040) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/04/trump-nbc-interview-constitution-economy/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-hes-unsure-whether-people-us-are-entitled-due-process-2025-05-04/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-due-process-comment-nbc-interview/))

2/ **Trump refused to fully rule out military action against Canada to make it the 51st state, saying it was “highly unlikely” but “could happen.”** Trump, however, left open the possibility of using force to acquire Greenland, saying: “We need that for international security.” Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carney, responded bluntly: “These are not idle threats.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/04/canada-trump-carney-military) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/04/trump-carney-canada-greenland-00325783) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/04/trump-greenland-denmark-military-force) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-greenland-military-force-canada/))

3/ **Mike Waltz, Trump’s recently fired national security adviser, was photographed using TeleMessage – an encrypted messaging app that stores chat logs – during a Cabinet meeting last week**. Days later, the company suspended all services after hackers claimed to have breached its servers and stolen data, including government contact lists and message data. TeleMessage, pitched as a “compliant” alternative to Signal, is used by multiple federal agencies despite security experts warning that archiving encrypted messages “breaks the security model.” Waltz was already under scrutiny for "Signalgate," when he accidentally added a journalist to a Signal thread discussing airstrikes in Yemen. Trump publicly scolded staff – “Maybe don’t use Signal, okay?” – before tapping Waltz for U.N. ambassador. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/signal-telemessage-hack-trump-waltz.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/messaging-app-tied-to-trump-cabinet-investigating-cyber-incident) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/mike-waltz-app-trump) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/661173/telemessage-signal-clone-hacked-mike-waltz))

4/ **Trump dismissed signs of an economic slowdown, saying the U.S. is in a “transition period” and would “do fantastically.”** The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter – the first decline since 2022 – driven by a surge in imports ahead of Trump’s tariffs and a slowdown in consumer spending. Housing starts fell more than 11% in March, construction costs rose due to tariff-driven supply hikes, and rents increased for the third straight month. The April jobs report showed modest growth, with 177,000 jobs added. Trump nevertheless blamed Biden – “That’s Biden. That’s not Trump” – but took credit for the stock rally, saying “the good parts are the Trump economy.” Markets had partially recovered after Trump delayed some tariffs. Trump also defended his trade policy despite warnings from economists and brushed off inflation concerns, saying, “They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,” and that “maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls.” Trump ended a key tariff exemption for small-value imports from China, raising costs for millions of online shoppers. Trump added: “The tariffs are going to make us rich.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-downplays-recession-fears-saying-us-ok-long-term-rcna203511) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-downplays-economic-concerns-as-he-looks-to-cut-trade-deals-e6a24bc2) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/trump-economy-biden-jobs-markets) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-rejects-concerns-prices-economic-uncertainty-defends-agenda-rcna203512) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/04/trump-wants-the-credit-but-not-the-blame-for-the-u-s-economy-00325501) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/05/housing-economy-tariffs-rates/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/economy/de-minimis-packages-tariff) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/economy/trump-china-tariffs-de-minimis.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/trump-kills-china-tariff-loophole-shein-temu-prices-are-soaring))

5/ **Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on films made outside the U.S.**, calling foreign movies a “national security threat” and blaming overseas incentives for the decline of U.S. filmmaking. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump posted on his personal social media network, adding that “Other nations have stolen our movie industry.” The White House, however, admitted that no final policy exists, but said it’s “exploring all options” to carry out Trump’s directive. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/business/trump-tariffs-movies.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/trump-movie-tariffs-entertainment-stocks) / [Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/trump-tariff-foreign-film-national-security-1236386566/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-films-hollywood-tariff-movies-415367dff6ae5bb7dc0871db5ac97d48) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/trump-authorizes-100-tariff-on-movies-made-overseas-757e3a10) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-vows-to-meet-hollywood-on-tariff-plan-that-shook-industry) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2025/05/05/trump-movie-tariffs-foreign-films-hollywood/))

6/ **The Trump administration will pay $1,000 and provide free airfare to undocumented immigrants who agree to self-deport using a government-run app**. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “the best, safest and most cost-effective way” to leave the U.S. without getting arrested. Migrants must confirm their departure through the CBP Home app to get the money. Trump said those who don’t leave voluntarily “will never get a path to come back in.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-pay-1000-undocumented-immigrants-deport-rcna204859) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/05/05/trump-immigrant-deportation-payments-stipend/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-offers-1000-stipend-encourage-migrants-self-deport-2025-05-05/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-to-pay-1-000-to-migrants-who-self-deport-769b0574) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-administration-offers-migrants-1-000-to-voluntarily-leave) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-mass-deportation-payment-border-illegal-c459325c4a73dba0d5a89fa19dbee334) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/trump-dhs-travel-costs-stipend-immigrants-self-deport.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/05/dhs-1000-plane-ticket-migrants-deport/83455872007/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/trump-deportation-stipend-money-homeland-security))

7/ **Trump ordered federal agencies to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz**, the former island prison shut down in 1963 over high costs and failing infrastructure. Alcatraz is currently a federally protected historic site run by the National Park Service, which draws more than 1 million visitors a year as a major San Francisco tourist attraction. “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ,” Trump said, claiming it would detain the “most ruthless and violent Offenders” and stand as a symbol of “Law, Order, and JUSTICE.” The Bureau of Prisons said it would begin an assessment, despite the island’s lack of water, power, and modern utilities. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, whose district includes the island, said: “The President’s proposal is not a serious one.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-alcatraz-prison-fabe3385415ae03829d44e50efb3c1fb) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/04/trump-alcatraz-movies-tariffs-00326220) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/05/nx-s1-5387239/trump-alcatraz-reopen) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/05/trump-alcatraz-prison-reopening/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-says-will-reopen-enlarged-rebuilt-alcatraz-prison-rcna204743) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/politics/trump-alcatraz-prisons-reopen) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-calls-for-alcatraz-to-become-a-prison-again-c252f5b5) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bureau-prisons-assessing-trumps-directive-reopen-alcatraz/story?id=121474332) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/trump-alcatraz-prison-rebuild-reopen))

8/ **Israel approved a plan to seize Gaza, displace most of its population, and take over aid distribution, with no timeline for withdrawal**. “We’re not going in and out,” Netanyahu said, confirming that troops will hold the captured ground indefinitely. “We’ll call up reserves to come, hold territory—we’re not going to enter and then exit the area, only to carry out raids afterward. That’s not the plan. The intention is the opposite.” The military will call up tens of thousands of reservists and launch the operation – codenamed “Gideon’s Chariots” – if no hostage deal is reached before Trump’s trip to the region next week. “If there is no hostage deal, the operation will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its goals are achieved,” a senior Israeli official said. Israel and private U.S. contractors will control all humanitarian aid, bypassing the UN, which called the plan a “pressure tactic” that violates humanitarian principles. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “We are finally going to conquer Gaza.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-05-2025-d22caabfd2cf89e83fe06e649e6438ba) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-plan-to-occupy-gaza-control-aid-distribution-90412130) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/israel-buildup-soldiers-hamas-gaza.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/israel-gaza-destroy-trump-deal) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/05/05/israel-may-seize-all-of-gaza/83458258007/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/04/israel-gaza-war-expansion-reservists/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/middleeast/israel-gaza-expansion-hnk-intl))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the CDC to search for measles treatments using drugs and vitamins as the U.S. faces its worst outbreak in decades**. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, is promoting unproven remedies like cod liver oil, budesonide, and clarithromycin – despite no evidence they cure the virus – instead of endorsing the safe and effective measles vaccine. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/kennedy-cdc-alternative-measles-treatments) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5280215-over-900-measles-cases-confirmed-us-29-states-cdc-says/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-measles-treatment-guidance/))

2. **The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to let Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access millions of Americans’ Social Security data**. Lower courts have blocked the move, calling it a “fishing expedition” and said the intrusion “is not in the public interest.” The Fourth Circuit also backed that view, writing:  “There is no evidence DOGE’s work requires full access,” and noting that Musk’s team sought privileges reserved for only a few top officials. The Trump administration claims the data is needed to root out fraud but hasn’t shown why anonymized information isn’t enough. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/doge-social-security-trump-administration-supreme-court-a38db8e9908e56b01265432f4d46e8e3) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-grant-doge-access-social-secur-rcna204548) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/02/trump-doge-supreme-court-social-security-00324876) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/supreme-court-doge-social-security.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-02/trump-asks-supreme-court-for-doge-access-to-social-security-data))

3. **Trump told the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy “I love you guys”** during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Enrique Tarrio, who served less than two years of a 22-year sentence for helping organize the Jan. 6 Capitol attack before receiving Trump’s pardon, said Trump recognized him and "called me and my mother over \[...\] said he was sorry for what Joe Biden did to all J6ers." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/politics/trump-tarrio-proud-boys-pardon.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-mar-a-lago_n_6818a2f6e4b064ed9fd4de80) / [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/194864/january-6-proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-trump-said-i-love-you))

4. **The Trump administration reached a tentative settlement with the family of Ashli Babbitt, a Capitol rioter fatally shot while trying to breach a barricaded door near the House chamber on Jan. 6**. The terms remain secret, but the family had demanded $30 million in a wrongful death suit that accused Capitol Police of “ambushing” her. The Justice Department had previously cleared Lt. Michael Byrd, saying his actions “potentially saved members and staff from serious injury and possible death,” but reversed course after Trump took office. Trump has repeatedly praised Babbitt, called the officer a murderer, and publicly considered payouts to Jan. 6 rioters. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/05/02/trump-justice-babbitt-jan6-settlement/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/02/trump-administration-reaches-settlement-in-principle-with-rioter-shot-by-cop-on-jan-6-00324453) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5280122-justice-department-capitol-riot-settlement/))

5. **Trump signed an executive order to cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS**, accusing them of spreading “radical, woke propaganda” and calling public support for media “corrosive” to journalistic independence. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt funding “to the maximum extent allowed by law.” PBS and NPR leaders condemned the move as unlawful and politically motivated. “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the president’s authority,” CPB President Patricia Harrison said. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/02/npr-pbs-trump-executive-order-response-00323798) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-signs-executive-order-stop-federal-funding-npr-pbs-rcna204375) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-npr-pbs-republicans-public-broadcasting-f0e3e1acb96986732a0211833165bf84))

6. **Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself as pope on Truth Social and the White House’s official accounts, then denied involvement**. “I had nothing to do with it,” he said, though he later claimed “the Catholics loved it” and that his wife thought it was “cute.” The image appeared days after he joked, “I’d like to be pope,” adding that he would be his “number one choice” for the job. JD Vance, meanwhile, defended the image, saying, “I’m fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars.” Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met privately with Pope Francis one day before the pope died. “Do not mock us,” the New York Catholic Conference said. Cardinal Dolan, who Trump had floated as a candidate for pope, called the image “not good.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-pope-photo-ai.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/white-house-post-ai-generated-picture-donald-trump-pope/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/04/nx-s1-5386516/catholic-leaders-criticize-trump-ai-pope-photo) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/03/vance-ai-pope-trump-00325197) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/us/politics/trump-pope-photo.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5281355-vance-trump-ai-pope-post/))
