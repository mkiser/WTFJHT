1/ **Trump warned House Republicans that failure to pass his tax and spending bill would be “the ultimate betrayal.”** Trump demanded immediate passage of the bill – which would make his 2017 tax cuts permanent, eliminate federal taxes on tips and overtime wages, cut Medicaid by tightening work requirements, and reduce clean-energy tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act – "to show the American people that they’re serious about ‘promises made, promises kept.’” Trump also warned that GOP holdouts “wouldn’t be a Republican much longer” if they vote against it. Despite the push, several Republicans continue to resist, citing rushed negotiations, lack of bill text, and opposition to a $40,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have also objected to the weaker Medicaid work requirements and the delayed rollback of green energy tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, said the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years, which under current law would trigger automatic spending cuts starting in 2026. Medicare could face cuts of up to 4% annually, totaling nearly $500 billion over a decade, unless Congress intervenes. Economists have also warned that eliminating taxes on tips and overtime – both subject to payroll taxes – could weaken Medicare’s long-term funding by reducing its primary revenue source. Separately, the bill’s changes to Medicaid, including the new work requirements and cuts to state financing methods, could cause nearly 9 million people to lose coverage. That would put added pressure on Medicare, which covers 13 million Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay premiums and out-of-pocket costs. As of now, the House Rules Committee has been meeting since 1 a.m., but hasn’t advanced the bill. Republican leaders, however, say a vote could still happen as soon as today, though Speaker Mike Johnson hasn’t formally scheduled one.

* **The Senate unanimously passed the No Tax on Tips Act**. Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, brought the bill to the floor, where no senators objected to its passage by unanimous consent. The bill creates a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for cash tips reported to employers. It applies to workers earning $160,000 or less. The bill now heads to the House, where Republicans are considering whether to pass it as a standalone bill or fold it into the broader tax package they’re working on. Estimates suggest the measure could reduce federal revenue by $110 billion over 10 years.

2/ **The Justice Department moved to dismiss police reform agreements in Minneapolis and Louisville – days before the anniversaries of the killings that prompted them**. George Floyd was murdered on May 25, 2020; Breonna Taylor was killed on March 13 the same year. The Biden-era DOJ found both departments engaged in unconstitutional policing and negotiated court-enforceable consent decrees. The Trump administration, however, claimed that the findings were flawed and the agreements “would not be in the public interest,” calling the reforms “factually unjustified” and a form of “federal micromanagement.” Both cities, meanwhile, said they will move forward with the proposed reforms, including limits on use of force, improved officer training, and independent monitoring without Justice Department oversight.

3/ **Trump used a televised Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to push false claims that White Afrikaner farmers are facing a “genocide.”** Trump dimmed the lights and played video clips showing chants of “Kill the Boer,” then waved printouts of articles, saying they showed “death, death, death.” Ramaphosa, who was visibly uncomfortable, denied the claims and said that the video “is not government policy,” while his agriculture minister added: “We have a rural safety problem, not genocide.” South African police data shows 12 farm-related murders last year, including both farmers and workers, with no racial breakdown and no evidence of systematic targeting. Trump, meanwhile, [granted refugee status](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2025/05/12/day-1574/#the-trump-administration-granted-ref) to 59 White South Africans this month while cutting aid and restricting protections for nonwhite asylum seekers.

4/ **A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration “unquestionably” violated a court order by deporting eight men to South Sudan without giving them time to object**. Judge Brian Murphy said the men were given “roughly 24 hours” notice, mostly outside business hours, making it “impossible” for them to contact lawyers or prepare a challenge. “I don’t see how anybody could say these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object,” Murphy said. The flight carried men from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, and South Sudan, and landed in Djibouti after leaving Texas. Of the eight on board, only one was a South Sudanese citizen. Nevertheless, the Department of Homeland Security called the deportees “monsters” and accused Murphy of trying to “dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States.” Murphy, meanwhile, threatened contempt proceedings and ordered officials to determine whether the men can still be granted due process.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar for use as Air Force One**. Trump had pushed for the $400 million gift, calling it a "great thing," as delays have slowed delivery of Boeing’s new presidential jets. The Air Force will oversee retrofitting the Qatari plane to meet security and operational standards, though details remain classified. Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about security, whether accepting the plane is legal under the Constitution, and the cost of converting the 13-year-old jet, which experts estimate could exceed $1 billion. The aircraft will eventually be transferred to Trump’s presidential library.

2. **The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Andrew Cuomo over allegations that he lied to Congress about his role in a July 2020 New York state report on COVID-related nursing home deaths**. The investigation began about a month ago following a renewed referral from House Republicans, which came after the DOJ dropped corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams – Cuomo’s rival in the New York City mayor race. The investigation is being handled by the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, which is now led by former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro – a longtime critic of Cuomo.

3. **The chief of staff to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard ordered intelligence analysts to rewrite an assessment that contradicted Trump’s claim that Venezuela directs the criminal gang Tren de Aragua**. Emails show Joe Kent told analysts on March 24 and April 3 to revise the report so it could not be "used against" Trump or Gabbard. The original assessment, dated February 26, found no credible evidence linking Venezuela’s government to gang operations in the U.S. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/gabbard-intelligence-venezuelans-tren-de-aragua-trump.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gabbard-advisers-email-tren-de-aragua-assessment-raises-concern-inside-intel-2025-05-20/))
