1/ **The House passed Trump’s tax and immigration package by a single vote after Speaker Mike Johnson made late-night concessions to win over Republican holdouts**. The 1,000-page bill, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” extends the 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, raises the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, expands business tax breaks, temporarily increases the child tax credit to $2,500, repeals most clean energy tax credits from Biden’s 2022 climate law, cuts Medicaid and SNAP by more than $900 billion, and imposes new Medicaid work requirements starting in 2026. The Congressional Budget Office projected the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the debt and result in 8.6 million people losing health coverage over ten years. The bill also includes a $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, which the Treasury Department says is needed by August to avoid default, overhauls the student loan system by replacing existing repayment plans with two options, imposes a 21% tax on wealthy university endowments, allocates $150 billion for military spending, and $46.5 billion for border enforcement. The legislation also creates $1,000 federally funded “Trump accounts” for babies born between 2024 and 2028. Trump, who directly pressured lawmakers and threatened primary challenges, claimed victory, saying: “Now, it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” Democrats, meanwhile, called the bill “one big broken promise,” citing CBO projections that the poorest 10% of households would lose 4% of their after-tax income while the top 10% would gain 2%. Senate Republicans, however, have already said they plan to rewrite major sections, including the Medicaid and tax provisions. The bill also faces additional constraints under reconciliation rules, and with key policies unresolved, Trump’s goal of signing it by July 4 is uncertain.

2/ **The Senate voted 51–44 to revoke California’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035**, eliminating a waiver granted by the EPA under Biden and overriding a legal opinion that said the repeal wasn’t allowed under the Congressional Review Act. Republicans, nevertheless, used a procedural workaround to bypass the Senate parliamentarian, who had said the waiver didn’t qualify. The vote also struck down two other California rules targeting truck emissions and smog pollutants. California’s ban had been adopted by 11 other states, together representing about 40% of the U.S. auto market. “The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act \[...\] is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California’s efforts,” Attorney General Rob Bonta said, who vowed to sue.

3/ **A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department, ordering the agency to reinstate over 1,300 fired employees**. Judge Myong Joun issued a preliminary injunction, writing that the “record abundantly reveals that Defendants’ true intention is to effectively dismantle the Department without an authorizing statute.” The ruling also barred the Trump administration from transferring federal education programs to other agencies. The Education Department said it would challenge the ruling, calling the decision “a dramatic overstep” by “a far-left judge.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/education-department-shut-down-layoffs-576eef90c30fdaeb660f7f66644bad10) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/judge-education-department.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/22/education-department-fired-federal-workers-reinstated/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/22/education-department-court-ruling-firings-00365170) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407521/trump-education-department-layoffs-injunction) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/education-department-judge-ruling) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-federal-ruling-trump-7bae75a9) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/22/trump-education-department-closing) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-blocks-trump-administration-attempting-dismantle-department-education/story?id=122078365) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/judge-halts-dismantling-education-department-fired-workers-reinstated-rcna208531) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/education-department-employees-must-be-reinstated-by-trump-judge.html))

4/ **The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on whether Oklahoma could create the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school**, leaving in place a state court ruling that blocked the effort. With Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused, the tie allowed the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision to stand, which found the proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School unconstitutional under both state and federal law. The ruling, however, didn’t set a national precedent, but stops a plan supporters said would “bring Catholic education to rural parts of the state” that critics called “a constitutional oxymoron.” Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who brought the suit, called the outcome “a resounding victory for religious liberty” and said it ensures “Oklahoma taxpayers will not be forced to fund radical Islamic schools.” \[*Editor’s note: Drummond’s comment reflects the argument from opponents that approving a Catholic charter school would force states to also allow religious schools of any kind*.\] ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-oklahoma-public-religious-charter-school-170e3701926e29ea5072eb50f0db97b6) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/22/supreme-court-deadlock-religious-charter-school-00365001) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/supreme-court-st-isidore-oklahoma) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-oklahoma-religious-school-ruling-95d8480b) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-oklahoma-launch-taxpayer-funded-religious-charter/story?id=120902550) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/supreme-court-religious-charter-school-oklahoma.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-sidesteps-major-ruling-religious-public-charter-schools-rcna204111) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/22/supreme-court-oklahoma-religious-charter-schools/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/22/supreme-court-oklahoma-religious-schoolt-tie))

5/ **The Trump administration revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, requiring nearly 6,800 current foreign students to transfer or lose their legal status**. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students," claiming – without evidence – that Harvard “fostered violence, antisemitism, and coordinated with the Chinese Communist Party.” Noem said Harvard “refused” to meet the Trump administration’s unusually broad demand for information on foreign students allegedly involved in “illegal and violent activities." She added: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities.” Harvard called the move “unlawful” and “retaliatory,” saying it “threatens serious harm” and “undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.” President Alan Garber said, “No government \[...\] should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/22/trump-harvard-international-students-enrollment-revoked/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/22/trump-harvard-international-students) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/harvard-blocked-by-government-from-enrolling-foreign-students) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/trump-harvard-students-international.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-blocks-harvards-ability-enroll-international-students-nyt-reports-2025-05-22/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The first report from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again Commission blamed childhood chronic illnesses on ultra-processed food, environmental toxins, overprescribed drugs, and corporate influence**. It calls U.S. children “the sickest generation in American history” and warns that poor health threatens national security. The 69-page report, however, avoids major regulatory proposals, but does support stricter food stamp rules, new dietary guidelines, and more research on vaccines and pharmaceuticals. Kennedy called it a “radical consensus” and pledged full policy recommendations within 100 days.

2. **House Republicans reopened their investigation into Biden’s mental fitness**, requesting interviews with his former physician Kevin O’Connor and four ex-White House aides. The Oversight Committee, led by James Comer, revived last year’s inquiry, citing new books and audio recordings that raised concerns about Biden’s cognitive state. Comer also questioned Biden’s use of an autopen to sign official documents, implying others may have made key decisions during his presidency. The committee hasn’t issued new subpoenas but said interviews could begin this week. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/house-gop-joe-biden-health-probe-7da43f3c) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/22/congress/comer-probes-bidens-fitness-00365560) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-autopen-investigation-biden-health-rcna208138))

3. **The Supreme Court allowed Trump to fire two Biden-appointed members of federal labor boards**, despite laws protecting them from removal without cause. In a 6–3 order, the conservative majority paused lower court rulings that had reinstated Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board. The court’s majority said the boards wield “considerable executive power” and Trump is “likely to show” he has authority to remove such officials. The justices, however, emphasized their decision didn’t apply to the Federal Reserve, calling it a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.” Justice Kagan dissented, writing: “Today’s order favors the President over our precedent.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-lets-trump-fire-heads-labor-worker/story?id=122091589) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/22/supreme-court-ruling-labor-regulators-00366433) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-trump-request-fire-independent-agency-members-rcna201152) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/22/supreme-court-commissioners-independent-officials/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-lets-trump-fire-nlrb-and-merit-board-members-cc2dc09a))

4. **Federal prosecutors charged Elias Rodriguez with murdering two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, calling it a targeted act of terror**. Surveillance video showed Rodriguez shooting Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in the back, then firing again as they lay on the ground. Rodriguez told police, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” and shouted “Free Palestine” as he was arrested inside the Capital Jewish Museum. Prosecutors said they’re treating the case as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/israel-embassy-jewish-museum-shooting-10307b3b1a2a337e76730736b12ebbcb) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/05/22/israeli-embassy-staff-dc-shooting-capital-jewish-museum/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/2-shot-fbi-field-office-washington-dc/story?id=122059162))

5. **The Treasury Department will stop minting new pennies early next year – ending production of the coin after over 230 years**. Each penny costs nearly four cents to produce, and the phaseout is expected to save $56 million annually. Businesses will be instructed to round cash transactions to the nearest five cents, while electronic payments will remain unchanged. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/penny-coin-mint-ending-2026-b1717de0) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/treasury-dept-winding-penny-production-rcna208522))

6. **Trump is scheduled to host his private, crypto-themed dinner tonight at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. for 220 people who spent a combined $394 million on his memecoin, $TRUMP, which is mostly owned by two Trump-linked companies**. The average participant spent over $1.7 million, with some paying as much as $37.7 million for access. About 72% of the winners appeared to be foreign nationals. Trump benefited financially through fees on every $TRUMP trade, which netted nearly $900,000 in the first two days.
