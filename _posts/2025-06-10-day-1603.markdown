1/ **Trump deployed 700 Marines and ordered 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles**, raising the total federal force in the city to nearly 5,000 amid protests over ICE immigration raids. The state of California sued to "immediately" block the deployments, arguing they were unconstitutional, but a federal judge denied the request for an emergency restraining order and set a hearing for Thursday. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called Trump’s moves “reckless” and said troops [arrived](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/national-guard-troops-los-angeles-sleeping-floor-newsom-trump) “without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep,” adding that “If we have to, we will clean up his mess.” Trump, meanwhile, described Los Angeles as a “trash heap” and claimed “entire neighborhoods” were controlled by “transnational gangs and criminal networks,” saying: “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again.” Attorney General Pam Bondi [added](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/bondi-says-federal-charges-coming-for-violent-protesters-in-la-00396019) that protesters who assaulted federal agents would face prosecution. “You spit on a federal law enforcement officer, we are going to charge you with a crime federally." At least nine people have been charged so far.

2/ **Gov. Gavin Newsom accused Trump of using military force to create "more chaos" in Los Angeles and intimidate political opponents**. “These are the words of an authoritarian,” Newsom said after Trump threatened to have him and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass arrested, and deployed Marines and National Guard troops to the city without state approval. “He’s sowing more division. He’s inciting just the same and more fear, more anxiety, more likelihood that people are going to be hurt.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, backed Trump and said Newsom should be “tarred and feathered.” He called the governor “a participant, an accomplice,” and claimed he was blocking federal law enforcement. One White House official said “We’re happy to have this fight," while one Trump adviser added: “This is what America voted for, period. This is the America First focus that got the president elected and is driven by nothing else than what he promised American voters. Look at the violence, the attacks on law enforcement,” the adviser added. “If Democrats want to support that, let them. This is why we win elections and they do not.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/gavin-newsom-trump-is-unhinged-speaking-like-an-authoritarian-00394617) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/09/gavin-newsom-trump-los-angeles-protests/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428342/per-california-gov-newsom-trump-order-to-send-in-guard-affects-all-states) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-happy-fight-trump-administration-leans-california-protests-rcna211860) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/speaker-johnson-backing-trumps-la-actions-newsom-tarred/story?id=122689990) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/la-protests-johnson-newsom-tarred-feathered))
 
3/ **The deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles will cost $134 million**, which will be drawn from operations and maintenance funds. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the 60-day mission during a House budget hearing, saying “Trump has said he will protect our agents,” and blamed local officials for protests triggered by ICE immigration raids. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, however, said the troops weren’t requested and not needed. Lawmakers cited photos of troops sleeping on government building floors and said many lacked food, water, and fuel. Rep. Pete Aguilar asked Hegseth: “Why were we not prepared to provide them with basics such as food and water?” Hegseth, nevertheless, called the claims “a disingenuous attack” and that the military was meeting needs “in real time.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/10/troops-deployed-to-la-will-cost-134m-pentagon-official-says-00396632) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/10/politics/pete-hegseth-capitol-hill-hearings) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/hegseth-defends-move-to-deploy-national-guard-and-marines-to-la) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5341983-defense-secretary-los-angeles-protest-budget/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-congress-hegseth-signal-hearings-c53cd37c2eae4327dd74e4c717057469))

4/ **Trump threatened to use “very big force” against “any” protesters at Saturday’s military parade in Washington**. Trump called protesters "people that hate our country" and promised they’ll "be met with very heavy force.” The $45 million parade, to mark the Army’s 250th anniversary, but also Trump’s 79th birthday, includes 28 tanks, 50 aircraft, and more than 7,000 troops. The Army, meanwhile, said “We’re not doing crowd control,” and reiterated that the it welcomes peaceful demonstrations. The Secret Service added that demonstrators are "simply people using that First Amendment right to protest.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-warns-protesters-military-parade-met-heavy-force/story?id=122692921) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/us/politics/trump-military-parade-protests.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/trump-military-parade-protesters-dc.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/trump-parade-protests-june-14-force))

5/ **The World Bank cut its U.S. growth forecast to 1.4% for 2025 – down from 2.8% in 2024 – citing “a substantial rise in trade barriers” from Trump’s tariff policies**. It also lowered its global forecast to 2.3%, down from 2.7% it projected in January – the weakest rate in 17 years outside of recession years – and warned that growth could drop further if Trump’s planned tariff hikes take effect in July. The current trajectory points to the slowest global growth since the 1960s.
