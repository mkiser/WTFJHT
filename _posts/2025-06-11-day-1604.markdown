1/ **California Gov. Gavin Newsom called Trump’s deployment of 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles “a brazen abuse of power" and an “assault on democracy.”** The troops are guarding ICE agents during immigration raids, which has sparked protests in Los Angeles that have spread to major cities, including Chicago, New York, Denver, and Austin. Newsom accused Trump of “pulling a military dragnet all across Los Angeles,” while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass added that the raids were “not trying to keep anyone safe – you’re trying to cause fear and panic.” Trump, however, defended the deployment, saying, “If we didn’t get involved, right now Los Angeles would be burning,” leaving open the option of invoking the Insurrection Act: “If there’s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it.” The Justice Department, meanwhile, dismissed California’s lawsuit seeking to block the military from assisting immigration agents as “a crass political stunt,” arguing that Trump had full authority to deploy troops without state consent. The Marines, however, are still in training and haven’t yet joined Guard troops on the streets. A court will hear California’s emergency motion on Thursday. “What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence,” Newsom said. “Do not give in to him.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/us/newsom-speech-trump-la-protests.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-gavin-newsom-california-immigration-protests-a6467fcd3fa66c945ac7c15c40362972) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/gavin-newsom-democracy-speech-trump-immigration-los-angeles-protests-rcna212237) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/gavin-newsom-democrats-fight-trump) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bondi-argues-trump-jan-6-pardons-create-double/story?id=122737210) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/11/la-protests-ice-live-updates-trump/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/11/gavin-newsom-donald-trump-los-angeles-protests-video/84146294007/))

2/ **Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will deploy National Guard troops ahead of planned anti-ICE protests**, saying Texas “will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles.” Troops are being stationed in cities including San Antonio, where Mayor Ron Nirenberg said he received “no notice” and called the move “external provocation.” Abbott said the Guard would “use every tool and strategy to help law enforcement maintain order,” though his office hasn’t specified how many troops will be used or where exactly. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/national-guard-texas-deploy-abbott.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-gov-deploy-national-guard-state-due-protests-rcna212275) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/texas-governor-to-deploy-national-guard-as-anti-ice-protests-spread-6347648f) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/11/texas-immigration-protests-national-guard-greg-abbott/84146626007/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/texas-governor-readies-national-guard-troops-ahead-of-protests))

3/ **The EPA will repeal federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and weaken mercury pollution rules**. The proposal would scrap Biden-era regulations that required coal and gas plants to cut carbon emissions or shut down by 2039, while also loosening limits on toxic substances like lead, arsenic, and mercury by up to 70%. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the move “a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and said the rules had “saddled our critical power sector with expensive, unreasonable and burdensome regulations.” More than 200 health experts warned the rollback “would lead to the biggest pollution increases in decades” and contradict the agency’s legal duty. The EPA also claimed U.S. power plant emissions “do not contribute significantly” to climate change, despite accounting for about 25% of U.S. greenhouse gases and more than 1.5 billion metric tons annually. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/trump-administration-epa-pollution) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/epa-power-plants-trump-coal-natural-gas-climate-b6421bf170e69b54a3ded2e575f1bc10) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/climate/epa-mercury-power-plants-greenhouse-gases.html) / [Heatmap](https://heatmap.news/climate/power-plant-emissions-epa-fervo) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/10/epa-to-repeal-climate-rule-power-plants-wednesday-00398136) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/trump-poised-to-repeal-biden-s-curbs-on-power-plant-pollution))

4/ **Trump plans to begin dismantling FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season**, cutting off most disaster aid and shifting control to state governments. “We’re going to give out less money,” Trump said. “It’ll be from the president’s office.” He added that “A governor should be able to handle it, and frankly, if they can’t handle it, the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said FEMA “fundamentally needs to go away as it exists” and told governors to expect less federal help going forward. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/fema-hurricane-season-phase-out-trump) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/06/10/trump-fema-states-hurricane-season/) / [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/06/fema-states-disasters/683103/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/why-fema-keeps-keeps-denying-disaster-preparedness-aid-to-states) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-fema-wound-hurricane-season-rcna212307))

5/ **The Justice Department said Trump can revoke national monuments created by past presidents**, reversing a 1938 legal opinion that said the Antiquities Act doesn’t allow it. In a 50-page memo released, the DOJ claimed Trump can eliminate monuments like Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands in California, which Biden designated before leaving office. The report argued, “the power to declare carries with it the power to revoke,” and said Biden’s protections focused on recreation, which are “wholly unrelated” to the law’s purpose. The White House said the goal is to free land for “oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral leasing.”  ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/06/10/trump-abolish-national-monuments/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-monuments-california-3e90d2eb00364e4184acfd101a2bb7b6) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/national-monuments-trump-justice-department))

6/ **Consumer prices rose 0.1% in May – less than forecast for the fourth month in a row** – bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.4%. The data showed little sign that Trump’s tariffs have raised prices, though some economists warned that “the bulk of increases from tariffs wouldn’t really start to show up until summer.” Trump dismissed inflation concerns, writing, “GREAT NUMBERS! FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT.” Fed officials plan to hold rates steady next week, saying it’s “too early” to judge the impact of tariffs. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/us-core-inflation-rises-less-than-forecast-for-fourth-month) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429597/inflation-tariffs-cpi-economy) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/economy/us-consumer-price-index-may) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/11/trump-tariffs-may-inflation/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/business/cpi-may-inflation-tariffs.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/cpi-inflation-may-2025-interest-rate-9c75074f))

7/ **The U.S. ordered nonessential staff to leave the Baghdad embassy and approved voluntary departures for military families across the Middle East**, citing “heightened security risks.” The State Department said the move followed a security review, but gave no specifics. Trump, meanwhile, said he’s “getting more and more less confident” about a nuclear deal with Iran, calling Tehran’s behavior “a shame.” Iran’s defense minister warned, “We will target all US bases in host countries without hesitation” if attacked.

8/ **Trump will restore the Confederate-era names of seven Army bases, reversing changes Congress mandated in 2021**. Speaking at Fort Bragg, he listed Fort Pickett, Fort Hood, Fort Gordon, Fort Rucker, Fort Polk, Fort A.P. Hill, and Fort Robert E. Lee. “We won a lot of battles out of those forts – it’s no time to change,” he said. The Army claimed the names will now honor different soldiers with similar surnames, such as Master Sgt. Gary Gordon or Pvt. Fitz Lee, but Trump contradicted that, saying “Fort Robert E. Lee” would return outright.

9/ **Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said she used artificial intelligence to decide which JFK assassination documents to keep classified**. “We have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously,” Gabbard said. The Trump administration released about 80,000 pages in March, following Trump’s January order to publish the files without redactions.
