1/ **Trump abruptly left the G7 summit in Canada and returned to Washington as the Israel-Iran conflict escalated**. Before departing, he posted a series of messages on social media demanding Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,” warning that “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran” (a city of about 9.5 million people), and claimed the U.S. knew “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” but added, “We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”  Trump also rejected the idea of a ceasefire, saying he wants “An end. A real end." Trump also claimed, without citing new intelligence, that Iran was “very close” to building a nuclear weapon. The statement [contradicted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/17/gabbard-trump-intelligence-iran-nuclear-program/2b217428-4b8e-11f0-8fff-262d6ec54ab9_story.html) March [testimony](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-gabbard-iran-nuclear-weapon-testimony) from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who told Congress that “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon,” and that Supreme Leader Khamenei “has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.” Asked about her remarks, Trump replied: “I don’t care what she said. I think they were very close to having it.” Israel has already launched airstrikes on Iranian military and energy sites and said it killed Maj. Gen. Ali Shadmani, a senior commander. Satellite images showed Israeli bombs damaged underground areas of Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility. The U.N. nuclear watchdog described the impact as more serious than earlier reports. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said Israel would continue the operation until Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities were destroyed. As fighting entered its sixth day, evacuations in northeastern Tehran increased and internet service across Iran remained disrupted.

2/ **Trump held a closed-door national security meeting to weigh a possible U.S. strike on Iran’s Fordo nuclear site**, an underground facility that Israeli forces can’t reach without American help. The meeting followed Israel’s request for the U.S. to provide its 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, which only American B-2 stealth bombers can deliver. Israel doesn’t have the weapons or aircraft to carry out such a strike. So far, the U.S. hasn’t approved the request, but officials said Trump is “seriously considering” it. The Pentagon confirmed that the USS Nimitz carrier group and other warships were diverted to the region, while dozens of U.S. refueling and transport aircraft were moved into position across Europe. “Protecting U.S. forces is our top priority,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding that the deployments were “precautionary” but that the U.S. was “prepared.” U.S. intelligence reports show that Iran is preparing potential missile attacks on American bases across the region if the U.S. joins the war. Commanders placed 40,000 troops on alert in Iraq, Jordan, and the UAE. Two senior Iranian officials told reporters the U.S. would be “hit first in Iraq” if it entered the war. Iran has already warned it could mine the Strait of Hormuz to pin American warships in the Persian Gulf or use proxies to strike U.S. assets. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/16/us-military-israel-iran/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-17/trump-to-meet-security-team-after-demanding-iran-s-surrender) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-situation-room-meeting-iran-israel-war) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/us/politics/iran-israel-us-bases.html))

3/ **A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced resolutions to block Trump from ordering U.S. military strikes on Iran without congressional approval**. In the House, Rep. Thomas Massie filed a resolution to end “unauthorized hostilities” with Iran, stating: “This is not our war. But if it were, Congress must decide such matters.” The resolution was joined by over a dozen progressive Democrats. In the Senate, Tim Kaine introduced a similar resolution requiring a declaration of war or formal authorization before any offensive use of force. No Republicans have signed on, so far. “The American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East,” Kaine said. Trump, meanwhile has warned Iran that if U.S. forces are attacked, retaliation will come “at levels never seen before.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/world/middleeast/kaine-trump-war-powers.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5354540-us-involvement-iran-house-resolution-bipartisan/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/17/congress/thomas-massie-iran-resolution-war-powers-00410454) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-war-powers-iran-israel-conflict) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-iran-israel-war-congress-massie-khanna) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-war-powers-act-congress-iran-israel/))

4/ **Trump said he won’t call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after a gunman killed a Democratic state representative and wounded a state senator in what authorities called a targeted political attack**. “I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out, I’m not calling him,” Trump said. “He’s a mess \[...\] So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?” Vance Boelter was charged with murder and stalking after a two-day manhunt. Police said he had a hit list of Democratic officials and Planned Parenthood locations. Meanwhile, Utah Sen. Mike Lee blamed the left and mocked Walz after the shootings, posting “This is what happens when Marxists don’t get their way,” followed by “Nightmare on Waltz \[sic\] Street” next to an image of Boelter. Sen. Tina Smith, who was reportedly on Boelter’s list, confronted Lee: “I wanted him to know how much pain that caused me and the other people in my state.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar called Lee’s posts “not a joke” and said she would address them in person. Lee later issued a generic statement condemning the violence and deleted his social media posts. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/us/trump-walz-minnesota-shootings.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-walz-minnesota-lawmakers-shot-call-064092d14bea4c3141da31b7a5e5c9b3) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/17/trump-walz-phone-call-00410141) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-wont-call-gov-tim-walz-minnesota-shootings-mess-rcna213432) / [Salt Lake Tribune](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/06/16/mineesota-shootinig-sen-amy/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2025/06/16/minnesota-shooting-mike-lee-twitter-posts-resign) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/politics/mike-lee-minnesota-assassination-democrats.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/16/congress/tina-smith-confronts-mike-lee-00409329) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/16/mike-lee-tina-smith-minnesota-shooting/))

5/ **The Senate Republicans’ revised version of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would slash Medicaid spending, shrink the child tax credit, and cap state and local tax deductions at $10,000**. The Senate draft rolls back key House compromises, including higher SALT deductions, smaller Medicaid cuts, and looser work rules. It also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, a sticking point for some conservatives. The Senate revision immediately triggered backlash from both chambers. “This needs a lot of work,” Sen. Josh Hawley said, warning the bill would “defund rural hospitals effectively in order to what, pay for solar panels in China?” Sen. Ron Johnson called the legislation a “nonstarter,” adding that “We’re not doing anything to significantly alter the course of the financial future of this country.” At least four Republican senators have raised objections – enough to sink the bill. House Republicans, meanwhile, warned the Senate to not gut their SALT deal, with Rep. Mike Lawler saying the $10,000 cap was “dead on arrival.” Senate leaders, however, admitted the bill lacks the votes and described the current text as a placeholder to “start negotiations,” though they are still aiming to pass it by July 4. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-finance-committees-version-big-beautiful-bill-sets/story?id=122910234) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-17/tax-bill-lacks-votes-as-senate-aims-for-deals-on-salt-medicaid) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/16/trump-tax-bill-senate-republicans-child-tax-credit/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/16/senate-republicans-cool-to-finance-committees-tax-plan-00409755) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/politics/senate-bill-medicaid-cuts.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-republicans-finance-committee-trump-budget-bill-medicaid-taxes/))

6/ **The House Republicans’ tax and spending bill would add $2.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade – more than previously estimated – because higher interest costs outweigh the modest economic growth it would generate**, according to a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. An earlier static score put the cost at $2.4 trillion. The new estimate incorporates Republicans’ claim that tax cuts would boost growth, but the CBO found those effects would be “more than offset” by increased borrowing costs. The agency projects a 0.5% increase in GDP over 10 years and an average 0.14 percentage point rise in interest rates, adding $441 billion in new interest payments on the national debt. “It’s not only not paying for all of itself, it’s not paying for any of itself,” Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, dismissed the findings and said the bill would still “unleash the American economy.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/gop-megabill-would-increase-deficits-even-more-after-including-economic-growth-cbo-says-e9fdc315) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-17/house-tax-bill-boosts-deficit-2-8-trillion-cbo-analysis-shows) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/cbo-trump-tax-cuts-budget-deficit-355a929637110adf1712df882360a995) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/17/trump-presidency-news/#link-OT6BH4UN6VDOBCG4MQBF4AI6T4))

7/ **The Trump administration ordered ICE to resume immigration raids at farms, hotels, and restaurants**, reversing a four-day pause that had briefly paused enforcement. Homeland Security officials told field offices that “worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone” of the administration’s plan, ordering ICE agents to resume operations. The shift followed Trump’s Sunday social media post ordering officials to pursue the “single largest Mass Deportation Program in History," despite previously saying the raids were hurting “very good, long time workers.” An internal memo last week had warned that exempting key industries would “eliminate a significant number of potential targets.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/06/16/trump-farms-hotels-immigration-raids/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/ice-raids-farms-hotels-trump) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/deportations-raids-business-farms-630a917e) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-whiplash-immigration-raids) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-backtracks-ice-arrests-farmers-hotel-workers-rcna213469))

* **Federal agents arrested New York City Comptroller Brad Lander inside a Manhattan immigration courthouse after he linked arms with a migrant facing detention and refused to let go**. Video showed Lander shouting “Do you have a judicial warrant? I will let go when you show me the judicial warrant” as ICE agents wrestled him against a wall and handcuffed him. Homeland Security claimed he was arrested for “assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer,” but released him hours later without charges. “You don’t have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens,” Lander said while being cuffed. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who later entered the building, called the arrest “bullshit."
