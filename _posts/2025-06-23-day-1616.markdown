1/ **Iran launched a missile strike on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, retaliating for U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites two days earlier**. Qatar said its air defenses intercepted most of the 14 missiles fired, with one striking near the base; no casualties were reported. Trump called the strike “very weak” and thanked Iran for giving “early notice,” adding, “Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system.’” Iran claimed the number of missiles matched the U.S. bomb count and said the attack “posed no danger” to Qatar. The Pentagon said the base had been evacuated and confirmed it was hit with short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Iran also launched missiles toward the U.S. Ain al-Assad base in Iraq, but they failed to reach their target. On Saturday night, the U.S. launched coordinated airstrikes using B-2 bombers and submarines to hit three Iranian nuclear sites – Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan – marking the first direct U.S. military attack on Iran since 1979. Trump said the sites were “completely and totally obliterated” and warned that if Iran doesn’t make peace, “future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.” He said the mission was a “spectacular military success” aimed at ending the “nuclear threat posed by the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror.” Iran’s foreign minister called the strikes “outrageous” and said the country “reserves all options” to defend itself. Trump ordered the strikes days after saying he would decide on military action “within two weeks.” European allies, U.S. intelligence agencies, and the U.N. nuclear watchdog had warned against attacking active enrichment sites, citing risks of radiation and escalation. While Trump did briefed congressional leaders, he rejected seeking formal approval from Congress to authorize the strikes. Trump later posted, “CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-war-nuclear-trump-bomber-news-06-23-2025-9e78510c88ccc5e262341f41550609c5) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/23/iran-retaliation-trump-israel-war) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/23/trump-convenes-situation-room-meeting-as-iran-claims-attack-on-us-base-in-qatar-00418756) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/g-s1-74059/iran-attack-us-bases-iraq-qatar) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/23/israel-iran-live-updates-us-trump/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/23/world/iran-trump-israel-news) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-iran-live-updates-irans-khamenei-punishment-israel/?id=123109706) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/live-blog/live-updates-iran-top-diplomat-meets-putin-us-braces-retaliation-rcna214428) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/23/iran-qatar-missiles-us-doha.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-us-strikes-06-23-25-intl-hnk) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/iran-launches-missile-strike-at-us-air-base-in-qatar-tasnim) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-israel-us-latest-news) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/21/world/iran-israel-trump) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-22/us-successfully-attacked-three-nuclear-sites-in-iran-trump-says) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/21/us-bombed-3-iranian-nuclear-sites-trump-says-00416403) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/nx-s1-5439075/israel-iran-conflict-hospital) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/21/us-strike-iran-nuclear-israel-trump) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-strikes-iranian-nuclear-site-trump-says-rcna213781) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/21/b-2-bombers-iran-trump/))

2/ **Trump called for regime change in Iran, posing on social media, “Why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???”** The comment directly contradicts his own administration’s repeated claims that the U.S. wasn’t trying to overthrow Iran’s government. “We don’t want to achieve regime change,” JD Vance said, insisting that the U.S. was “not at war with Iran” but “at war with Iran’s nuclear program.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, said Trump was “just simply raising a good question,” but added, “our posture has not changed.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/politics/trump-iran-strikes-regime-change-analysis) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/22/trump-iran-regime-change) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/23/leavitt-trump-regime-change-comment-00418478) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362854-vance-not-at-war-with-iran-but-with-nuclear-program/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/vance-says-us-not-war-iran-re-war-irans-nuclear-program-rcna214329) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/trump-administration-says-it-doesnt-want-regime-change-and-admits-it-may-happen-00417738) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/22/iran-us-war-nuclear-weapons))

3/ **Pentagon officials can’t confirm whether U.S. strikes destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities despite Trump’s claim the program was “completely and fully obliterated.”** Defense Secretary Hegseth confirmed that the three sites hit sustained “severe damage,” but admitted a final assessment would “take time.” Rafael Grossi, head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, said inspectors must be allowed to verify “the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%.” ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/22/hegseth-iran-nuclear-sites-pentagon) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/hegseth-iran-strikes.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/trump-claims-obliteration-iran-nuclear-sites-missing-uranium-rcna214439) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/severe-damage-pentagon-iran-strikes-00416557) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hegseth-caine-us-attack-iran-nuclear-sites-misdirection/story?id=123091195))

4/ **Trump’s strike on three Iranian nuclear sites triggered bipartisan backlash in Congress, with lawmakers accusing him of violating the Constitution by bypassing congressional approval**. “This is not Constitutional,” Rep. Thomas Massie said, adding that there was “no imminent threat to the United States.” Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna introduced a resolution to block further strikes unless Congress explicitly authorizes them. Sen. Tim Kaine called the attack “an offensive war of choice” and said he would force a Senate vote under the War Powers Act: “We should not be sending troops and risking lives without a debate in Congress.” Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, rejected efforts to hold a vote on war powers, saying Trump “used that authority judiciously,” claiming U.S. troops and assets were “in imminent danger” but offered no evidence. Democrats were not briefed in advance. “We’ve seen no evidence that an offensive strike of this nature was justified,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the strike “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” and warned Trump “impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congress-faces-uphill-battle-challenge-trump-war-powers/story?id=123116301) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/23/israel-iran-live-updates-us-trump/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-both-parties-question-legality-trumps-iran-strikes-rcna214316) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/22/2025/democrats-assail-trump-on-iran) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/21/maga-largely-falls-in-line-on-trumps-iran-strikes-00416450) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/23/world/iran-trump-israel-news))

5/ **Trump demanded energy producers keep oil prices low after U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites raised fears of retaliation and supply disruptions**. “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I’M WATCHING! YOU’RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY,” he posted on Truth Social. Trump also ordered the Energy Department to “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!” despite the agency having no control over private oil production. Oil prices had surged over the weekend, but dropped below $70 a barrel after Iran launched missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq and Qatar without hitting energy infrastructure.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to deport immigrants with criminal records to countries where they have no ties and may face torture**. The justices lifted a lower court’s order that required at least 10 days’ notice and a chance to challenge the removal. Immigrants have already been sent or scheduled for deportation to South Sudan, Libya, and Guatemala – all countries with documented instability, violence, or past abuse of returnees. The unsigned order offered no reasoning, but the court’s three liberal justices dissented. “The Government took the opposite approach,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, saying the ruling rewarded officials who “repeatedly defied” court orders. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-trump-deport-certain-immigrants-third-countries-rcna209419) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/23/supreme-court-third-party-country-deporations-00419210) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/g-s1-71529/supreme-court-south-sudan-deportation) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/23/trump-deportation-supreme-court.html))

2. **A federal judge ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from jail, rejecting the Trump administration’s claim that the Salvadoran man was a gang-affiliated threat to public safety**. Judge Barbara Holmes said the government failed to prove he posed any danger or flight risk, calling its case “strained” and based on “double hearsay” and “contradictory” testimony from informants seeking immigration favors. Prosecutors accused him of smuggling undocumented immigrants after a 2022 traffic stop, but Holmes found the evidence inconsistent and noted the charges involve smuggling – not trafficking or violence. Homeland Security, meanwhile, called the ruling “a mistake,” insisting, “he will never go free on American soil.” Abrego is likely to remain in ICE custody despite the order. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-denies-governments-motion-detain-kilmar-abrego-garcia/story?id=123105021) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/abrego-garcia-detention-trial) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/22/magistrate-judge-rejects-trump-admin-bid-to-jail-kilmar-abrego-garcia-ahead-of-trial-00417789) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/abrego-garcia-bail-smuggling-charges.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/abrego-garcia-deportation-error-c0a515baffdf54baba412edf4cdbd310))

3. **A federal judge ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil**, a Palestinian activist and Columbia graduate, rejecting the Trump administration’s attempt to keep him jailed without charges. U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz called the government’s case “highly, highly unusual” and found “a very strong and uncontested record” that Khalil wasn’t a flight risk or danger. “There is at least something to the underlying claim that there is an effort to use immigration proceedings here to punish the petitioner,” Farbiarz said, calling that “unconstitutional.” Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, was arrested in March after organizing pro-Palestinian protests; he missed his graduation and the birth of his son while detained. Homeland Security, meanwhile, called the ruling “yet another example of how out-of-control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/20/mahmoud-khalil-ordered-release-bail) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/judge-orders-mahmoud-khalil-released-00415566) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mahmoud-khalil-release-columbia-protest-trump-immigration-69162d21ab22377b1c1c08cf2c83d6cd) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-release-order.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-ordered-released-federal-judge-rcna214163) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-ice-release-order-7a96d082))

4. **A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from stripping Harvard of its authority to host international students**. Judge Allison Burroughs said the administration couldn’t enforce its May 22 revocation, ordering officials to “disregard” instructions to bar Harvard students at borders and consulates. The move came after Homeland Security pulled the university from the federal student visa program with no warning, prompting Harvard to sue. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the school argued in court filings. A Homeland Security spokesperson dismissed the ruling, saying, “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/harvard-trump-foreign-students-9498074cfe5f1054a712b9c21d36c6c5) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/politics/harvard-foreign-students-ruling) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/international-students-harvard-preliminary-injunction.html))

5. **Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments** under a new law signed by Gov. Greg Abbott. The law mandates a specific English version be posted in every classroom, despite a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a similar Kentucky law as unconstitutional. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court reached the same conclusion on Friday, blocking nearly identical legislation in Louisiana. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/texas-ten-commandments-law-3f1ea84acd67a028ad9b7c01c3c2368c) / [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-appeals-court-blocks-louisiana-law-requiring-ten-commandments-in-classrooms))

6. **The Trump sent layoff notices to 639 employees at Voice of America**, gutting the federally funded news agency and cutting total staff by 85%. Kari Lake, a Trump adviser and head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said the agency was now “near its statutory minimum” and would retain just 250 staff across all outlets. Lake, who previously promoted a plan for One America News to supply VOA content for free, called VOA “a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy” and said: “that ends now.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/media/kari-lake-voa-trump-voice-of-america-staff) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/voice-america-layoffs.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/voice-of-america-staff-terminations-00415425) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/voice-of-america-layoffs-trump-global-media-7a862bdc530dd3d48657c00d2df54539))
