1/ **A classified U.S. intelligence report found that Trump’s airstrikes on Iran failed to destroy the country’s underground nuclear facilities or enriched uranium stockpile**. The Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the attacks set Iran’s program back “maybe a few months, tops,” contradicting Trump’s claim that the sites were “completely demolished.” The strikes damaged aboveground infrastructure at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, but didn’t penetrate deep enough to collapse underground chambers or disable centrifuges. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the leaked assessment “flat-out wrong” and blamed a “low-level loser” for trying to “undermine the President.” Meanwhile, briefings for House and Senate members on the operation were postponed. No explanation was given. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, called the delay “outrageous” and said lawmakers were owed a full accounting of what was destroyed. Rep. Mike Quigley, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said, “They don’t delay briefings that have good news.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/iran-nuclear-sites.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-program-military-strikes-trump-f0fc085a2605e7da3e2f47ff9ac0e01d) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/early-us-intel-assessment-finds-us-strikes-set/story?id=123169267) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/24/house-senate-briefings-iran-israel-middle-east) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/congressional-iran-briefings-postponed-amid-ceasefire-agreement) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/24/us-iran-bomb-assessment-nuclear-sites-not-destroyed/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-announces-israel-iran-ceasefire-2025-06-23/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/24/us-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-back-months/84340477007/))

2/ **Israel and Iran agreed to a tentative ceasefire despite both sides violating the agreement almost immediately after Trump announced "a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE."** Israel said Iranian missiles killed four civilians, while Iran accused Israel of launching strikes before the truce began. The development prompted Trump to publicly rebuke both countries: “They don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.” He warned Israel, “DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION.” Trump said he personally called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told him to stop further strikes: “You gotta call back the planes. It’s enough.” Netanyahu’s office confirmed Israel “refrained from additional attacks” after the call. “I’m not happy with Israel,” Trump told reporters. “You don’t go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/24/iran-israel-us-trump-ceasefire-updates/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/24/trump-f-word-israel-iran-ceasefire/84329896007/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/24/an-angry-trump-decries-israel-iran-for-breaking-ceasefire-00420048) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-trump-ceasefire-attacks-continue-f1e60190722cc3410b69f21717872ffa) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/24/world/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-lashes-israel-iran-dont-know-f-re-rcna214712) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-blurts-expletive-lashes-israel-iran-ceasefire/story?id=123153888) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-rebukes-israel-post-ceasefire-strikes-2025-06-24/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-demands-israel-stop-dropping-bombs-on-iran-to-save-truce) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5366254-israel-iran-ceasefire-netanyahu-trump/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/24/nx-s1-5443201/israel-iran-ceasefire-trump) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-israel-us-latest-news))

3/ **Trump questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO’s mutual defense pledge hours before arriving at the alliance summit in the Netherlands**. Asked if he supported Article 5, Trump replied, “Depends on your definition,” adding, “There’s numerous definitions of Article Five. You know that, right?” and “I’m committed to being their friends.” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte privately thanked Trump for his “decisive action in Iran” and said “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.” Trump also claimed he would define his stance later, saying: “I just don’t want to do it on the back of an airplane.” Leaders are expected to vote on Trump’s demand to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP.

4/ **Trump was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the ceasefire between Israel and Iran hours after a Ukrainian lawmaker withdrew a separate nomination over Trump’s failure to deliver on his promise to end the war with Russia**. Rep. Buddy Carter sent a letter to the Nobel Committee praising Trump’s “extraordinary and historic role” and claimed he had prevented Iran from obtaining “the most lethal weapon on the planet.” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s foreign affairs committee, said he had “lost any sort of faith and belief” in Trump and accused him of “dodging” sanctions on Russia. Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Pakistan condemned Trump’s airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities less than 24 hours after nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

5/ **The House voted 344–79 to kill an impeachment resolution against Trump over his strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, with 128 Democrats joining all Republicans to block the effort**. Rep. Al Green introduced the resolution, accusing Trump of bypassing Congress and violating its authority to declare war. Democratic leaders, including Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, opposed the move, calling it a distraction. After the vote, Trump called Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “stupid” and “one of the ‘dumbest’ people in Congress” for saying the strikes were “clearly grounds for impeachment.” He added, “go ahead and try Impeaching me, again, MAKE MY DAY!” Ocasio-Cortez responded: “Don’t take your anger out on me — I’m just a silly girl. Take it out on whoever convinced you to betray the American people and our Constitution by illegally bombing Iran.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/24/iran-israel-us-trump-ceasefire-updates/#link-4NPUEOREEBDKNLHSU6OWOTLNOE) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5366252-trump-attacks-ocasio-cortez-bombing-iran/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/24/trump-aoc-iran-impeachment-israel-middle-east) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/aoc-trump-impeachment-iran-strikes-edc0cc52) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/24/congress/most-democrats-vote-to-kill-impeachment-measure-00421254) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/24/trump-aoc-omar-jasmine-crockett/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/24/trump-impeachment-trump-iran-al-green-democrats))

6/ **Sen. Bill Cassidy called for a delay of the CDC vaccine panel meeting, saying Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new appointees “lack experience” and could undermine trust in federal vaccine policy**. Cassidy, who voted to confirm Kennedy after receiving private assurances that the advisory panel would remain intact, said Kennedy broke that promise by firing all 17 members and replaced them with eight new ones, some with ties to anti-vaccine groups. The CDC’s vaccine panel reviews data and votes on who should get which vaccines and when, shaping national guidelines that affect public health policy, insurance coverage, and school requirements. The panel is expected to meet Wednesday without a Senate-confirmed CDC director to review vaccines for COVID-19, RSV, flu, and anthrax. One CDC vaccine expert quit in protest last week, warning that “a lot of Americans are going to die” if Kennedy’s changes stand. Kennedy, however, defended the firings at a House hearing, calling the former panel “a template for medical malpractice.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/key-senator-calls-to-delay-meeting-of-new-rfk-jr-vaccine-panel) / [STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/23/bill-cassidy-calls-for-acip-vaccine-panel-delay-after-rfk-jr-purge/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-lacks-experience-not-meet-cassidy-says-rcna214658) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/23/congress/cassidy-acip-rfk-vaccine-cdc-00419614) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/cassidy-kennedy-vaccine-committee.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/23/cassidy-vaccine-panel-hhs-rfk/))

7/ **The Trump administration will repeal the 2001 “roadless rule,” which blocked logging and road construction on 58 million acres of national forest land since 2001**. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins called the Clinton-era rule “absurd” and "outdated" and said repealing it would end “overly restrictive” limits on forest access. The change would affect nearly a third of all U.S. national forest land, including 9 million acres in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, home to centuries-old trees and major carbon stores. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/logging-national-forests-0607a77e0ab812ea6fa609034fbb20d9) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/g-s1-74136/trump-to-rescind-roadless-rule-which-protects-58-million-acres-of-forest-land) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/06/23/roadless-rule-public-lands-repeal/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/climate/trump-end-protections-for-58-million-acres-of-national-forests.html))

8/ **A fired Justice Department lawyer accused top officials of planning to ignore federal court orders to carry out Trump’s deportation plan**, according to a whistleblower complaint submitted to Congress and the DOJ inspector general. Erez Reuveni said senior DOJ leaders, including Emil Bove, told staff that deportation flights should proceed “no matter what” – even if a judge blocked them. Bove is Trump's nominee to serve a lifetime appointment as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. During a March 14 meeting, Bove allegedly said DOJ might need to tell courts “fuck you” and move ahead anyway. Reuveni was fired weeks later after admitting in court that a migrant had been deported in violation of a judge’s order.

9/ **ICE is detaining 59,000 immigrants nationwide – the highest number ever recorded**. Nearly half have no criminal record, and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. The detainee count is 40% over the 41,500 beds Congress funded. ICE made most arrests in the U.S. interior, not at the border, and ramped up large-scale raids with the help from other federal agencies.
