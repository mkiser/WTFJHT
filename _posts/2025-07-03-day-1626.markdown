1/ **House Republicans passed Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax-and-spending bill by a 218-214 vote after overcoming weeks of internal disputes and late-night negotiations to flip holdouts**, which ultimately required direct pressure from Trump, who called the legislation “the biggest bill ever signed of its kind.” He said that flipping skeptics was “very easy.” All Democrats and two Republicans opposed a bill, while some Republicans criticized the process and policy, but voted yes anyway. The 887-page bill makes Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, adds new tax breaks for tips, overtime, and seniors, increases spending for border security and defense, raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, cuts Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion, cuts SNAP benefits by $185 billion, imposes stricter work requirements for safety-net programs, and phases out most clean-energy tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion and lead to 11.8 million fewer Americans with health insurance coverage by 2034, while 3 million more would lose SNAP benefits. Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the megabill as “a key cornerstone of America’s new golden age." House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delayed the vote with a record-breaking 8-hour, 44-minute floor speech, calling Trump’s signature legislation “an immoral document” that would “end Medicaid as we know it.” He warned that “People will die,” and said Republicans were taking “a chain saw” to the safety net. “What is contemplated in this one big, ugly bill is wrong. It’s dangerous, and it’s cruel,” Jeffries said. “We don’t work for Donald Trump. We work for the American people,” he added, urging lawmakers to “vote no” on what he called “a crime scene.” After the vote, Trump told reporters he thinks the bill is “going to make this country into a rocket ship, it’s really great,” adding: “I think I have more power now.” Trump plans to sign his “big beautiful bill” on July 4th at the White House.

2/ **The U.S. economy beat expectations and added 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%**. Most of the gains came from state and local government, health care, and education, while private-sector job growth slowed to its weakest pace since October. Manufacturing and federal employment each lost 7,000 jobs, and the labor force shrank for the second straight month as 130,000 people left. Trump, nevertheless, claimed the “economy is BOOMING.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/june-jobs-report-unemployment-hiring) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/03/federal-reserve-economic-benchmarks-data-challenges/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/june-jobs-report-likely-to-extend-feds-summer-pause-2e523c1e) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/03/economy-jobs-powell-fed-trump-immigration-tariffs-00438231) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/jobs-report-takes-pressure-off-fed-despite-signs-of-weakness) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/nx-s1-5455636/the-u-s-labor-market-remains-solid-with-employers-adding-147-000-jobs-last-month) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/business/what-to-know-about-the-jobs-report.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/jobs-report-june-2025.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs-report-june-2025-unemployment-economy-c1f54222) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/03/economy/us-jobs-report-june-final))

3/ **Trump made “no progress at all” with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine**. The call came two days after the U.S. paused shipments of air defense missiles and other weapons to Ukraine, Trump claimed the U.S. hadn’t officially stopped support and needed to “make sure we have enough for ourselves.” The Kremlin said Putin told Trump that Russia “will not back down.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/trump-putin-speak-ukraine-iran) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-holds-first-call-with-putin-after-pause-in-ukraine-weapons-shipments-65ec9805) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/03/us/trump-news-policy-bill#trump-putin-call-ukraine-iran) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/02/us-ukraine-weapons-halted-air-defense/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/pentagon-under-scrutiny-over-decision-to-halt-weapons-to-ukraine))

4/ **The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to deport eight foreign nationals to South Sudan**, overturning a lower court’s order that blocked the removals. Only one of the men is from South Sudan; the others are from Cuba, Vietnam, Myanmar, Mexico, Laos, and South Korea. They were held for six weeks in a converted shipping container on a U.S. military base in Djibouti. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the ruling lets Trump “send the eight noncitizens \[...\] to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/03/supreme-court-third-country-deportations-south-sudan-00439701) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/us/politics/supreme-court-migrants-south-sudan.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/03/politics/supreme-court-migrants-djibouti-south-sudan) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/supreme-court-clears-trump-to-send-migrants-to-south-sudan))
