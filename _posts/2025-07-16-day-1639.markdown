1/ **Trump disavowed his supporters demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling them “weaklings” who “bought into this bullshit.”** Trump accused his "PAST supporters" of doing “the Democrats’ work” and said he didn’t want their support, calling the case a “hoax” that “nobody cares” about. "I don’t want their support anymore!" The statement follows a Justice Department memo concluding there was no Epstein “client list," contradicting Attorney General Pam Bondi’s earlier claims that such documents existed and were under review. Bondi now says she was referring to general case files, not a list, and has refused to commit to releasing more. Trump’s base, meanwhile, has fractured parts of the MAGA movement with conservative figures like Laura Loomer and Alex Jones accusing Trump of betrayal. Loomer warned the scandal could “consume his presidency.” House Speaker Mike Johnson also split from Trump, calling for “transparency” and urging Bondi to clarify her role. Rep. Thomas Massie launched a discharge petition with Democrat Ro Khanna to force a vote compelling the DOJ to release all Epstein-related files. Other Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, have backed the move, which could trigger a full House vote after the recess. Trump, meanwhile, insists any further release is up to Bondi, but repeated that only “credible information” should be made public.

2/ **Trump told House Republicans he was considering firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, showing them a draft termination letter, but hours later publicly said it was "highly unlikely."** In that meeting, Trump asked if he should remove Powell and said “almost all of them said I should,” but added, “I’m more conservative than they are.” A senior White House official said Trump would “likely” act soon, while Rep. Anna Paulina Luna posted that Powell’s firing was “imminent.” Trump later denied the reports, saying “we’re not planning on doing anything,” but added: “I don’t rule out anything [...] unless he has to leave for fraud.” Trump has demanded the Fed cut interest rates by up to 3 points, calling Powell a “total stiff” and “terrible,” while accusing him of wasting money on a “palace,” saying, “I think it sort of is” a fireable offense. Powell has defended the $2.5 billion renovation and asked the inspector general to review it. The Fed, meanwhile, has held rates steady while warning Trump’s tariffs could push inflation higher.

4/ **The Justice Department asked at least nine states to turn over their voter rolls**, with two states complying and others reviewing the requests. Separately, Republican election clerks in Colorado said a consultant claiming to work with the White House contacted them to request access to voting machines. Some clerks rejected the request outright, calling it a security risk. The White House, however, didn’t confirm its connection to the consultant, but said it supports ensuring only citizens are on voter rolls.

5/ **The Trump administration deported five men from Vietnam, Laos, Jamaica, Cuba, and Yemen to Eswatini in southern Africa**, restarting third-country deportations after a recent Supreme Court ruling. Homeland Security said the men had criminal records including murder, child rape, and assault. The Eswatini government confirmed the men are being held in a local prison and plans to return them to their home countries, but didn’t say how long they will be held. ICE guidelines allow deportation to third countries within six hours, even without assurances against torture.
