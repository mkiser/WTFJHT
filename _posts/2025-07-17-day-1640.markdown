1/ **The Justice Department fired the federal prosecutor who led the criminal sex-trafficking cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell**. Maurene Comey is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who [Trump fired in 2017](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/09/Day-110/#1-trump-fired-james-comey-on-the-rec). Her firing follows pressure from Trump’s supporters over the administration’s refusal to release more Epstein records. Influential pro-Trump figures, including Laura Loomer, demanded Comey’s firing and accused the DOJ of hiding evidence to protect elites. Trump has called the Epstein files “bullshit” and claimed they were “made up by Comey” and others. Comey said her dismissal was conveyed “summarily” by a memo signed by a political appointee, not her supervisor, and that no cause was given. One official, however, said: “Being a Comey is untenable in this administration.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-james-comey-maurene-trump-dda5d1f40f08346bd97696ce4791e8ec) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/politics/maurene-comey-fired-sdny) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/16/maurene-comey-fired-doj-00458921) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/07/16/maurene-comey-fired-epstein-diddy/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/nyregion/maurene-comey-prosecutor-fired-jeffrey-epstein.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/17/maurene-comey-fired-james-comey-epstein-diddy/85254587007/))

2/ **After being fired without explanation, Maurene Comey warned her former Justice Department colleagues that “fear is the tool of a tyrant.”** Comey said her termination showed that “if a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain.” She urged staff to resist intimidation, calling for “righteous indignation at abuses of power,” and to remain committed to “truth above all else.” The Justice Department has refused to explain the decision. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/maurene-comey-letter-firing-00459560) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/epstein-comey-trump-tyrant.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-comey-epstein-justice-department-sean-combs-6a75266874bb7723ac83a9b548b7d257) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/maurene-comeys-farewell-after-firing-fear-tool-tyrant/story?id=123844070) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/nyregion/maurene-comey-fired-trump.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/maurene-comey-urges-doj-colleagues-stand-abuses-power-memo-firing-rcna219436))

3/ **Trump rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein case**. Trump dismissed demands from allies like Rep. Lauren Boebert and activist Laura Loomer, who said the issue could “consume his entire presidency.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, confirmed that Trump wouldn’t recommend a special prosecutor, saying "That’s how he feels.” ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/17/trump-jeffrey-epstein-special-prosecutor/85259934007/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/trump-esptein-special-counsel-00460146) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-wont-recommend-special-prosecutor-for-epstein-matter-white-house-says-e04304d9) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5406733-trump-epstein-special-prosecutor/))

4/ **Senate Republicans pushed through Emil Bove’s nomination for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit after cutting off debate and ignoring a whistleblower request**. Every Democrat walked out of the Judiciary Committee hearing in protest after Chairman Chuck Grassley refused to delay the vote or allow testimony from whistleblower Erez Reuveni, who alleged that Bove encouraged lawyers to defy court orders during Trump’s deportation push. “This lacks decency. It lacks decorum,” Sen. Cory Booker said, who objected before leaving the hearing. More than 900 former DOJ lawyers and 75 retired judges opposed Bove’s nomination, citing his work as Trump’s defense lawyer, his role in firing DOJ staff tied to Jan. 6 cases, and his push to drop bribery charges against Mayor Eric Adams. Grassley, nevertheless, defended the vote, calling the misconduct claims “unsubstantiated.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5467260/trump-emil-bove-judge) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/emil-bove-nomination-senate-judiciary-committee/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-challenge-whether-emil-boves-controversial-judicial-nominati-rcna219346) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/senate-democrats-protest-bove-nomination-00459557) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/politics/emil-bove-judge-nomination-democrats.html))

5/ **The Senate voted 51–48 to rescind $9 billion in federal funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting**. The bill eliminated $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and cut $7.9 billion from foreign aid programs. Two Republicans – Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski – joined Democrats in voting no, saying it gave the White House too much control over congressionally approved funds and failed to specify what programs would be cut. They also warned the rescissions would damage rural public media and gut foreign aid programs. The House must pass it by Friday to prevent the funds from being automatically released. Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to withhold endorsements from House Republicans who voted against the cuts.

6/ **The House passed the GENIUS Act, sending the first major federal crypto bill to Trump for final approval**. The bill, which won bipartisan support, sets rules for stablecoins – a win for an industry that spent over $130 million backing pro-crypto candidates. Crypto-backed PACs have already raised $141 million for the 2026 elections. The House also passed the Clarity Act, which would shift crypto oversight away from the SEC and toward the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency that regulates markets for derivatives, like futures and swaps, and has some authority over commodities trading. The bill, however, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Trump and his family also stand to benefit from the new rules through financial ties to World Liberty Financial, which launched its own stablecoin, USD1. "This is a vote to give Trump the pen to write the rules that would put more money in his family’s pocket,” Rep. Maxine Waters said.
