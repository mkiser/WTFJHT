1/ **The U.S. and European Union reached a trade deal that sets a 15% baseline tariff on most European imports and avoids a 30% tariff threatened by Trump before the Aug. 1 deadline**. He said the EU agreed to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion in the U.S., though EU officials admitted the investment pledge came from private companies and wasn’t guaranteed. “This is the biggest of them all,” Trump said, adding, “It’s great that we made a deal today instead of playing games.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal eliminates tariffs on aircraft parts, semiconductor equipment, and some agricultural goods. Neither side released the full text, and major details remain unresolved.

2/ **During a meeting at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland to discuss the U.S.-UK trade agreement with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump spent most of the session defending himself over his past ties to Jeffrey Epstein**. In an extended exchange with reporters, Trump said Epstein “stole people that worked for me” and claimed that’s why he cut ties, adding, “I threw him out \[...\] persona non grata.” Trump denied ever visiting Epstein’s island and dismissed a reported birthday letter to Epstein with a nude sketch and his signature as “fake,” saying, “I don’t do drawings of women.” The hour-long press conference overshadowed the trade agenda and took place during a $10 million taxpayer-funded trip centered on golf at his private resorts. Meanwhile, a viral video from the trip showed Trump pulling up his cart near a sand trap as his caddie walked ahead and appeared to drop a ball in the grass – reviving past accusations that he cheats at golf. Protesters across Scotland also mocked the visit with signs referencing Epstein, fake scores, and what one called “the most expensive round of golf in history.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-epstein-friendship-scotland-falling-out-a9896c04fcf932f232f1b319154eb800) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/28/trump-jeffrey-epstein-island-visit) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-hired-help_n_6887a11ae4b067dd8147578e) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/28/politics/trump-epstein-relationship-scandal-scotland) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/26/g-s1-79744/scotland-protesters-anti-trump-golf) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/world/europe/trump-protest-scotland.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-plays-golf-scotland-nationwide-protests/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/28/trump-golf-cheating-accusations-scotland/85402663007/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/26/politics/trump-scotland-golf-epstein-scandal))

3/ **Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche gave Ghislaine Maxwell limited immunity during two days of closed-door interviews, allowing her to name roughly 100 individuals without risk of self-incrimination**. Trump sent Blanche – his former defense attorney – after Maxwell requested the meetings following a July 4 DOJ memo that denied the existence of a Jeffrey Epstein client list and said no further prosecutions were warranted. The memo contradicted earlier public promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi and triggered backlash from Trump’s base and Congress. Trump then ordered DOJ officials to pursue sealed grand jury records. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking with Epstein, has since filed a Supreme Court appeal arguing that Epstein’s 2007 plea deal shielded her from federal charges. Her lawyer said the government “made a deal, and it must honor it.” The Justice Department, however, opposed the appeal, but hasn’t explained why its top official met with her privately and without input from the prosecutors who tried her case. Trump, whose name appears in the Epstein files, has denied any connection and sued The Wall Street Journal over a birthday letter included in the documents. When asked if he might pardon Maxwell, Trump said he hadn’t thought about it but added, “I’m allowed to do it.” Her lawyer confirmed, “She would welcome any relief.” Congress has subpoenaed DOJ records and scheduled a deposition with Maxwell next month. Senate Democrats are demanding transcripts of the interviews and a public pledge that Trump won’t grant a pardon. Trump’s efforts to deflect – including floating conspiracy theories about Obama and Harris, attacking wind turbines, and traveling abroad – have failed to contain the fallout. The Epstein case has stalled House business, divided Trump’s supporters, and exposed fractures inside his administration.

4/ **Trump publicly rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim that “there is no starvation in Gaza,” calling images of starving children “real starvation stuff” and saying, “you can’t fake that.”** Trump added that “Those children look very hungry,” and said “We have to get the kids fed.” He said the U.S. and E.U. countries would “set up food centers” with “no boundaries,” but gave no timeline or logistics. Senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces, meanwhile, said they found “no evidence that Hamas regularly stole from the United Nations,” contradicting Israel’s long-standing claim used to justify aid restrictions. And for the first time, two major Israeli rights groups, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel, said Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. B’Tselem cited “coordinated action to intentionally destroy Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip.” The Israeli government called the accusations “obscene and baseless in both fact and law.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-gaza-israel-netanyahu-ad726ad46bce50cf1e023f50a37e5b3d) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/28/trump-starvation-gaza-israel-aid/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/world/middleeast/hamas-un-aid-theft.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-u-s-europe-to-send-more-aid-to-gaza-b7d83af9) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/28/trump-break-netanyahu-gaza-starvation-00479739) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/28/netanyahu-gaza-humanitarian-aid-politics/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/israel-aid-gaza-starvation-food-military-pauses-rcna221415) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/28/trump-rejects-netanyahu-starvation-food-crisis-gaza/85404936007/) /[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/world/middleeast/israel-genocide-gaza-rights-groups.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/28/trump-starvation-gaza-israel-netanyahu) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-it-is-pausing-fighting-in-parts-of-gaza-to-allow-aid-in-43966641) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5482881/israel-gaza-genocide-rights-groups-btselem-physicians) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-starvation-gaza-america-first.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/malnutrition-deaths-gaza-hamas-health-ministry/story?id=124128635))

5/ **A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from stripping Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood, calling the law “punitive” and likely unconstitutional**. Trump’s "big, beautiful bill" banned Medicaid funds to any provider that both performs abortions and received over $800,000 in 2023. Judge Indira Talwani, however, said “Congress singled \[Planned Parenthood\] out with punitive intent” without naming them, forcing clinics to either drop abortion services or lose funding. Planned Parenthood said nearly 200 clinics were at risk of closing, affecting over 1 million patients. The White House called the ruling “absurd” and said it would appeal. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/28/politics/planned-parenthood-judge-funding-ban) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/planned-parenthood-funding-cuts-ruling-343034bc26917049d6d58a8ba8c58c21) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/planned-parenthood-medicaid-trump.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5423680-planned-parenthood-medicaid-lawsuit-injunction/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-backed-medicaid-cuts-planned-parenthood-2025-07-28/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/28/massachusetts-court-medicaid-planned-parenthood-ruling-trump))

poll/ **63% of voters view the Democratic Party unfavorably – the worst rating in 35-year history**. Voters said they trust Republicans more than Democrats on nearly every major issue, including the economy, inflation, immigration, foreign policy, and tariffs – even when they disapprove of how Trump handled those same topics. Democrats led only on healthcare and vaccine policy. However, when asked how they would vote in a congressional election held today, 46% said they would support a Democrat, compared to 43% for a Republican. In 2017, Democrats held an 8-point lead.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Twenty states and Washington, D.C. sued the USDA to block its demand for personal data from all SNAP applicants since 2020**. The agency ordered states to turn over names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, addresses, immigration status, and household details by July 30. California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the move an attempt to “create a culture of fear.”  ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5482842/snap-usda-privacy-lawsuit))

2. **The Trump administration will release more than $5 billion in public school funding it withheld since June 30**. The money supports teacher training, English-language instruction, and academic programs. Officials said the freeze was to review whether the funds supported a “radical left-wing agenda,” and announced new “guardrails” to ensure compliance with administration policies, but the funding delay drew bipartisan pushback and multiple lawsuits from states, school districts, and education groups. “This administration deserves no credit for just barely averting a crisis they themselves set in motion,” Sen. Patty Murray said. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/25/trump-administration-moves-to-release-billions-in-federal-education-cash-00477213) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-freeze-school-grants-released-gop-f9ac79dd44595fc9d8a3c72609cb5574) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/25/school-funds-released-trump-omb/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/25/trump-billions-returned-to-schools/85377935007/))

3. **A federal judge dismissed the Trump administration’s lawsuit against Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County over their sanctuary laws**. U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled the administration lacked legal standing and said the policies were protected by the Tenth Amendment. The White House said sanctuary cities “interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of Americans.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-administrations-lawsuit-chicago-sanctuar-rcna221197) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/25/judge-dismisses-doj-illinois-chicago-immigration-lawsuit/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/25/illinois-sanctuary-immigration-ruling-00477916) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/25/judge-dismisses-doj-sanctuary-lawsuit-against-illinois-chicago/85381781007/))

4. **The White House ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to stop using polygraph tests to find leakers after a senior adviser complained he might be forced to take one**. Multiple tests had already been conducted on staff, including special operations personnel and a senior military aide, with guidance from Hegseth’s attorney Tim Parlatore. Hegseth also threatened polygraphs for top generals and later blocked a planned promotion for one of them, Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/07/26/pete-hegseth-leak-investigation-trump/))

5. **The architect of Project 2025 launched a Republican primary challenge against Lindsey Graham in South Carolina**. Paul Dans said the race was a “battle for the future of MAGA” and called Graham a “swamp critter,” citing his past criticism of Trump and support for Ukraine. “This is our Senate seat,” Dans said, rejecting Trump’s endorsement of Graham earlier this year and framing the race as a test of the movement’s future. Graham adviser Chris LaCivita said Dans “parachuted himself” into the race and predicted his campaign would “end prematurely.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/project-2025-architect-paul-dans-lindsey-graham-senate-south-carolina-rcna221460) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/dans-project-2025-graham-south-carolina-senate-781a780ee4cd701d0b1d52d19e7a2892) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/28/project-2025-author-lindsey-graham-2026/85408870007/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/5423838-project-2025-paul-dans-senate/))
