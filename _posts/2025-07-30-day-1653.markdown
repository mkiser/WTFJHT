1/ **Texas Republicans proposed a new congressional map that would give them five additional U.S. House seats by redrawing Democratic districts in major metro areas and South Texas**. The map, pushed by Trump and introduced during a special session called by Gov. Abbott, would give Republicans control of 30 of Texas’ 38 House seats – nearly 80% of the delegation – each in districts Trump won by double digits in 2024. By consolidating Democratic voters and redrawing competitive or minority-heavy districts, the map could help lock in Republican control of the House through 2026. It includes four new majority-Hispanic seats redrawn to favor Republicans. Democrats called it “outrageously gerrymandered,” with Rep. Greg Casar accusing Republicans of “illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans.” Rep. Lloyd Doggett said the plan “relies on crooked lines instead of honest votes.” The map could be approved next week, but is almost certain to face court challenges.

2/ **The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, but two governors appointed by Trump dissented, calling for an immediate quarter-point rate cut**. The split vote from Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman mark the first time since 1993 that more than one Fed board member opposed a rate decision. For months Trump has publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates, calling him a “moron,” a “numbskull,” and a “total stiff.” He delivered a handwritten note demanding cuts to “1% or better,” publicly criticized the Fed’s $2.5 billion renovation project, and asked House Republicans if he should fire Powell, saying “almost all of them said I should.” Powell, meanwhile, has refused to budge, holding rates steady and warning that Trump’s tariffs had raised inflation forecasts and created economic uncertainty. “We have made no decisions about September,” Powell said, adding that the Fed is still assessing whether tariffs will create “a one-time shift” or “more persistent” inflation, which rose to 2.7% in June – up from 2.4% in May – and remains above the Fed’s 2% target. Trump, nevertheless, responded: “‘Too Late’ MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-two-officials-back-a-cut-6fc17c67) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/fed-holds-interest-rates-points-to-slowing-economic-activity) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fed-expected-hold-interest-rates-steady-resisting-trumps/story?id=124185010) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/economy/fed-rate-decision-july) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/30/fed-rates-hold-steady/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/fed-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-as-expected.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/30/business/federal-reserve-interest-rates) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5483961/federal-reserve-interest-rates-trump-pressure) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/07/30/2025/us-fed-keeps-interest-rates-steady-but-2-governors-dissent) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-powell-trump-rates-99d90bab1ba2faa0fc5d4a6106125da7) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5427938-federal-reserve-interest-rates/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-july-2025-what-to-know-rcna222028))

3/ **The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, but the data showed signs of slowing**. The jump was driven almost entirely by a 30% collapse in imports, which had surged earlier in the year as businesses rushed to beat Trump’s tariffs. When averaged with the first quarter’s 0.5% contraction, growth for the first half of 2025 was 1.25% – below last year’s 2.8% pace. A key measure of private spending by U.S. consumers and businesses rose just 1.2% – the weakest since 2022 – suggesting the economy is slowing down. Trump called the report “WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/business/us-economy-grew-in-second-quarter-as-tariffs-scrambled-data.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/30/gdp-q2-economy-tariffs/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rebound-us-economic-growth-second-quarter-masks-underlying-slowing-trend-2025-07-30/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/30/trump-economy-consumer-spending-accelerates-00483181) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5484219/economy-gdp-tariffs-growth) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/us-economy-rebounds-with-3-gdp-growth-after-trade-reversal) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/gdp-q2-2025-.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-gdp-q2-2025-359c022b) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/07/30/2025/us-economy-grew-at-3-rate-in-q2-as-imports-decreased) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/economy-gdp-second-quarter-trump))

4/ **Senate Democrats invoked a rarely used law to try to force the Justice Department to release the full Jeffrey Epstein case files**. Citing the 1928 “Rule of Five,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and all seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee sent a formal request to Attorney General Pam Bondi for “all documents, files, evidence or other materials” related to Epstein and his clients. Schumer said Trump had “broken that promise” after previously vowing to release the files and accused Republicans of hiding behind the issue. “If there’s nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?” he said. Democrats gave the DOJ until Aug. 15 and warned they may sue if the request is ignored. Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, said that the grand juries that indicted Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell only heard testimony from two law enforcement officials – not the victims, alleged accomplices, or associates. An FBI agent testified in both cases, while a New York police detective also testified in Maxwell’s case. The judges gave Epstein’s estate, Maxwell, and victims until Aug. 5 to respond to the unsealing request.

5/ **Kamala Harris said she will not run for California governor in 2026**, ending speculation about a return to state office after her 2024 loss to Trump. In a statement, Harris said, “after deep reflection, I’ve decided that I will not run for Governor in this election.” She added: “For now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office.” Multiple aides said the move “keeps the door open” for a third presidential bid.
