1/ **The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into whether D.C. police falsified crime data, even as city police data showed violent crime was down 27% this year and federal prosecutors had reported a 25% drop in Trump’s first 100 days**. Trump, nevertheless, posted on social media that “D.C. gave Fake Crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety.” Trump’s tied the investigation to his deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops, claiming it was needed because of “Fake Crime numbers.” Mayor Muriel Bowser, meanwhile, said “We are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we’re watching our crime numbers go down.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/dc-police-crime-data-investigation.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-crime-data-rates-washington-police-7429711db32e2cd44c5b70504cacef40) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/19/trump-police-dc-takeover-justice-department/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-investigating-whether-dc-police-manipulated-crime-d-rcna225886) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/politics/doj-is-investigating-whether-dc-crime-stats-were-manipulated))

* **Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey was appointed co-deputy director of the FBI**, joining Dan Bongino in the bureau’s second-highest role. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel following Bongino’s fallout with Bondi last month over the DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files. Bailey resigned from his Missouri post and said he was “forever grateful” for the opportunity to help “Make America Safe Again.” Patel said Bailey “will be an integral part” of Trump’s mission, and Bondi called him a “tremendous asset.” Bongino, who previously threatened to quit, posted simply: “Welcome. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/18/fbi-co-director-bongino-bailey-bondi-patel) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/08/18/2025/missouri-attorney-general-set-to-share-fbis-no-2-spot-with-bongino) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/politics/fbi-andrew-bailey-bongino))

2/ **National Guard troops from Republican-led states began arriving in Washington to support Trump’s law enforcement takeover of the capital**. About 869 Guard members were already in the city, with governors pledging about 1,000 more. Most have been deployed to tourist sites and metro stations rather than high-crime areas, and while they remain unarmed, Guard members confirmed they are training to carry M-17 pistols. “Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training,” the Army said. At the same time, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro ordered prosecutors to “charge the highest crime that is supported by the law and the evidence” and move more cases into federal court, where sentences are stiffer. The White House said the operation was “working,” citing 52 arrests. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said, “this is not about DC crime,” while a Brennan Center official called the deployment “a military occupation of the district.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/tourists-national-guard-washington.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/politics/national-guard-washington-dc-troops) / [The Handbasket](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/dc-national-guard-armed-m17-sig-sauer) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/pirro-has-ordered-her-office-to-maximize-criminal-charges-on-street-arrests.html))

3/ **Trump revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials**. The list from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard targeted those tied to the 2016 Russia assessment, which concluded Russia interfered in the election to help Trump. It includes senior CIA, NSA, and NGA officials, as well as former aides to Obama-era intelligence leaders and members of Biden’s National Security Council. Gabbard claimed the officials “betray their oath to the Constitution” and accused them of “politicization or weaponization of intelligence,” though the memo cited no evidence of wrongdoing.

4/ **Trump said Tuesday he ordered lawyers to review Smithsonian museums for “woke” content**. "The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future," Trump posted on social media. Trump vowed to apply “the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities,” where his administration has withheld federal funds to force changes. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/trump-smithsonian-museum-college-woke.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/19/trump-smithsonian-attorneys-woke) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/politics/trump-slavery-museum-smithsonian))

5/ **The Trump administration ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to require immigrants seeking citizenship to prove “positive contributions” beyond avoiding crimes**. Officers were told to weigh applicants’ “community involvement, achievements, and financial responsibility” and make decisions “on a case-by-case basis.” USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the goal was to offer citizenship only to “the world’s best of the best.” Critics said the rules are “so loose and discretionary that it is obviously susceptible to arbitrary enforcement.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/08/19/uscis-citizenship-good-moral-character-trump/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/19/trump-immigration-citizenship-good-moral-character))

6/ **Trump ruled out sending American troops to Ukraine**, saying: “You have my assurance, and I’m president.” He said Europe would “put people on the ground” while Washington might help “by air because there’s nobody that has the kind of stuff we have.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump “definitively” ruled out ground forces, but ordered his national security team to draft a framework for security guarantees. Russia, meanwhile, has rejected any plan involving NATO or international troops, warning such a move could cause “uncontrollable escalation.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/security-guarantees-are-coming-for-ukraine-putting-europe-on-the-hook.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-us-security-guarantees-b87d2091) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/19/trump-assurance-us-troops-ukraine-russia-peacekeeping/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/19/us/trump-zelensky-ukraine-russia) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/trump-boots-security-ukraine-00513967) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-08-19-25) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/europe-races-to-leverage-trump-s-support-for-ukraine-troop-plan))

7/ **Trump told “Fox & Friends” that his reason for trying to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is because “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible."** Trump added: “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.” Meanwhile, Karoline Leavitt said: “I think the president was serious. I think the president wants to get to heaven.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/trump-heaven.html))
