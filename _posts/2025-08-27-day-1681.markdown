1/ **The FDA revoked emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines and restricted access to new shots**, limiting eligibility to people 65 and older and to those ages 6 months to 64 with health conditions. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the EUAs “once used to justify broad mandates on the general public during the Biden administration, are now rescinded.” Under the new policy, Moderna is cleared for ages 6 months and up with a condition, Pfizer for ages 5 and up, and Novavax for ages 12 and up. The American Academy of Pediatrics called the move “deeply troubling,” and the Infectious Diseases Society of America warned it “puts millions of lives at risk.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-narrows-under-65-covid-vaccine-eligibility-maintains-full-access-older-2025-08-27/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-covid-vaccines/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-27/us-approves-latest-covid-shots-with-new-limits-on-who-gets-them) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5473277-covid-vaccine-emergency-use-fda-rfk/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/27/covid-vaccine-2025-fda-recommendation-rfk))

2/ **Robert F. Kennedy Jr. removed the CDC director less than a month after her confirmation for “not supporting President Trump’s agenda.”** Susan Monarez, who won confirmation on a 51–47 party-line vote after telling senators “vaccines save lives,” had refused to endorse Kennedy’s push to roll back coronavirus vaccine approvals. Three senior officials quit the same day, including Demetre Daskalakis, who said he couldn’t serve amid the “ongoing weaponizing of public health,” and Debra Houry, who warned, “Vaccines save lives — this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact. Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-director-monarez-out-confirmed-rfk-jr-rcna227620) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-monarez-kennedy-vaccines.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-director-monarez) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-27/cdc-director-ousted-weeks-into-her-tenure-washington-post-says))

3/ **At least 30 FEMA employees were placed on administrative leave after signing an open letter warning that Trump’s leadership left the agency unable to respond to major disasters**. The letter, signed by about 180 current and former staffers, said FEMA’s “current trajectory” under Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “reflects a clear departure” from reforms made after Hurricane Katrina. It cited leaders without  “legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required,” cuts to preparedness programs, and Noem’s $100,000 spending approval rule, which staff said delayed the flood response in Kerrville, Texas. A FEMA spokesperson dismissed the dissenters “the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency,” while Stand Up for Science, which organized the letter, said the suspensions showed “retaliation against our civil servants for whistleblowing.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/climate/fema-suspends-staff-who-criticized-trump-cuts.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/fema-workers-letter-administrative-leave-trump) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/08/26/fema-employees-leave-trump-administration-letter/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fema-employees-signed-letter-monday-critical-admin-leave/story?id=125014793) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/766890/trump-fema-employees-suspended-letter) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/fema-employees-fired-criticizing-trump-administration-open-letter-rcna227509))

4/ **Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News host now serving as U.S. attorney in Washington, failed to secure a felony indictment against a man who threw a Subway sandwich at a federal officer**. A grand jury rejected the charge against Sean Charles Dunn, a former Justice Department employee now known as the “Sandwich Guy,” even though indictments are generally almost always approved. “Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!” Dunn shouted before throwing the sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent. The decision came after jurors separately refused three times to indict a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/politics/washington-dc-sandwich-thrower-indictment-failure) / [Washington Post](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/politics/washington-dc-sandwich-thrower-indictment-failure) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/grand-jury-declines-indict-sandwich-guy-threw-sub-dc-federal-officer-rcna227464) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/washington-sandwich-thrower-indictment-trump-5d6ca5e2834eb0bb7ebe28a5ad188101) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/feds-indictment-grand-jury-sandwich-thrower-trump-dc.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/grand-jury-declines-indictment-washington-dc-sandwich-thrower) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-c-u-s-attorney-no-indictment-sandwich-assault/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/politics/trump-sandwich-assault-indictment-justice-department.html))

5/ **More than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed under Trump’s “crime emergency” in Washington have been assigned trash collection, mulching, and graffiti removal alongside policing duties**. The Pentagon confirmed over 40 cleanup projects while Attorney General Pam Bondi said the crackdown led to 1,178 arrests and 123 seized firearms. The White House said 40 of those arrested were undocumented people with prior records, and 49 homeless encampments have been cleared. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously pledged to focus on “lethality, lethality, lethality,” but Guard members are now landscaping, with one saying, “It’s nice, as a D.C. resident. But there are different things we could be doing.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/27/dc-national-guard-trash-removal-trump-takeover/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/trump-national-guard-beautification-dc))

6/ **The Trump administration said it will take over control of Washington’s Union Station from Amtrak and the Union Station Redevelopment Corp**. Transportation officials blamed crime, homelessness, and disrepair, but also confirmed they are shelving a $10 billion expansion in favor of limited fixes like lighting, elevators, and a new roof. While Mayor Muriel Bowser backed the federal role, calling it “a very significant and good investment,” D.C. Council member Charles Allen said canceling the expansion was “a big step backwards.” The takeover is not yet official, with formal action expected in September.

1. **Democrats flipped a Republican-held Iowa Senate seat in a district Trump won by 11 points last year**. Catelin Drey defeated Christopher Prosch 55–44, breaking the Republican supermajority and forcing Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to seek bipartisan support for judicial and cabinet nominees. It’s Democrats’ fourth special election gain in Iowa this year, each showing strong over-performance compared to 2024.
