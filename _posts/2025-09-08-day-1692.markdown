1/ **House Democrats released Trump’s lewd 2003 letter to Jeffrey Epstein that he insisted was “nonexistent,” “false, malicious, and defamatory.”** The page from Epstein’s “birthday book” shows a typed dialogue surrounded by a nude outline of a woman and ends, “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,” with “Donald” signed below the waist to mimic pubic hair. [In July](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2025/07/21/day-1644/#trump-sent-jeffrey-epstein-a-sexuall), Trump called the letter a “fake thing” because “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words," before suing the Wall Street Journal for $10 billion over the report. At the time, JD Vance also called the story “complete and utter bullshit,” asking: “Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” The White House, meanwhile, repeated that “Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,” though archived correspondence shows he sometimes signed only his first name in a similar style. The letter came as part of a release of Epstein estate documents subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee. The estate also turned over Epstein’s 2019 will, his 2007 non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors, contact book entries from 1990 to 2019, and financial records. Lawyers said redactions were made to shield women and minors, but committee staff will review unredacted copies. Both parties on the panel said more materials will be released after review. Following the disclosure, Rep. Robert Garcia, the committee’s top Democrat, said: “Trump called the Epstein investigation a hoax and claimed that his birthday note didn’t exist. Now we know that Donald Trump was lying and is doing everything he can to cover up the truth.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/epstein-birthday-book-congress-9d79ab34) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/house-oversight-receives-epstein-estate-files-00550721) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-book-rcna229803) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-led-house-oversight-committee-expected-receive-epstein/story?id=125365100) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/08/house-oversight-jeffrey-epsteins-birthday-book-subpoena) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-epstein-birthday-book-oversight.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/politics/epstein-estate-birthday-book-documents-house-oversight) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-epstein-letter-democrats-12c17f4c94cf14727062331526680ade) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/politics/epstein-trump-birthday-book.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/epstein-estate-documents-congress/))

* **Trump’s Justice Department asked a judge to keep the names of two people Jeffrey Epstein paid $100,000 and $250,000 in 2018 secret, even though both were protected from prosecution in his 2008 deal**. Prosecutors already said the payments “suggest the defendant was attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him.” The two individuals were “uncharged third parties” who had “expressly objected” to having their names unsealed. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-says-names-two-associates-epstein-wired-100k-250k-stay-secret-rcna229408) / [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article311986109.html))

2/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump was “an FBI informant” in the Jeffrey Epstein case, but later walked back the claim, admitting he might not have used the “right terminology.”** Johnson said he was “recounting what others have said,” citing a victims’ attorney who once described Trump as helpful, though he gave no evidence that Trump ever worked with federal investigators. Johnson’s office later said Trump was “the only one \[...\] willing to help prosecutors,” while the White House, Justice Department, and FBI gave no comment. Johnson added: “This is much ado about nothing.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/08/congress/mike-johnson-donald-trump-epstein-informant-00550679) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/07/trump-epstein-johnson-fbi/) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-trump-epstein-fbi-informant_n_68bb6626e4b0a7895196701f) / [Mediate](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/speaker-johnson-suddenly-claims-trump-acted-as-an-fbi-informant-on-epstein/) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-epstein-fbi-snitch-house-speaker-confusion-1235422703/))

* **A Justice Department aide was filmed claiming the government would “redact every Republican” from an Epstein client list**. Joseph Schnitt later claimed he was only repeating media reports. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/04/epstein-files-ghislaine-maxwell-doj-chief))

3/ **A federal appeals court upheld the $83.3 million judgment that Trump repeatedly defamed E. Jean Carroll by calling her a liar who would “pay dearly” after he was found liable for sexually abusing her in the 1990s**. In 2024, a federal jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages for Trump’s 2019 statements as president denying her assault allegations, saying she was “not my type,” and accusing her of making up the story to sell a book. The appeals court said the damages were “fair and reasonable” and rejected Trump’s claim of presidential immunity, citing “ample evidence” of reckless disregard. Trump’s team, meanwhile, called the case “political weaponization of our justice system,” while Carroll’s lawyer said the ruling confirmed “that E. Jean Carroll was telling the truth, and that President Donald Trump was not.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/nyregion/trump-e-jean-carroll-defamation.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-appeal-award-d587004df6f7c46ec4a17b563a38bfa9) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-carroll-defamation-appeal.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/trump-s-83-3-million-carroll-defamation-verdict-survives-appeal) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/trump-e-jean-carroll-defamation-appeal/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-e-jean-carroll-case-appeal-5acce6db) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/08/trump-e-jean-carroll-appeals-court) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/appeals-court-upholds-e-jean-carrolls-83-million-judgment-trump-rcna212907) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/politics/e-jean-carroll-jury-award-trump))

4/ **The Supreme Court let the Trump administration resume “roving” immigration patrols in the Los Angeles area**, lifting a lower-court order that had restricted ICE raids. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” but said it can be a “relevant factor” with others. The Court’s majority didn’t explain its decision, which came through the emergency docket. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, meanwhile, dissented: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/supreme-court-ice-raids-ruling-00550551) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-immigration-stops-los-angeles-rcna223845) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/politics/supreme-court-los-angeles-immigration.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-lifts-restrictions-trump-immigration-tactics-california/story?id=125368918) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/politics/supreme-court-ice-patrols-california) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-lifts-limits-on-immigration-enforcement-tactics-in-los-angeles-327f4922) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/supreme-court-lifts-limits-immigration-raids-los-angeles-area/))

5/ **The Department of Homeland Security launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records**, vowing to “hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.” ICE said, “No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens,” and promised to “surge” resources in the city. The announcement followed Trump’s weekend "Chipocalypse Now" post (modeled on the 1979 film "Apocalypse Now"): “I love the smell of deportations in the morning \[...\] Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city “received no notice,” while Gov. JB Pritzker said, “Once again, this isn’t about fighting crime” and called Trump “a scared man” and “a wannabe dictator.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/09/08/ice-midway-blitz-chicago-trump/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534338/ice-chicago-boston-immigration-raids) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/chicago-immigration-crackdown-trump-administration.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/ice-launches-midway-blitz-with-trump-threats-rattling-chicago) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/operation-midway-blitz-chicago-ice-operations-immigration-crackdown/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/06/politics/trump-chicago-war-meme-post) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-chicago-immigration-war-department-pritzker-1f6b2a08ed8aab04f0caf02ef506aafa) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/donald-trump-threatens-chicago-deportations-department-war-crackdown-rcna229544))

* **Trump signed an executive order to rebrand the Department of Defense as the "Department of War,"** saying it sends “a message of strength.” The order, however, doesn’t change the agency’s legal name, which Congress must approve. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-department-of-war-8cb6fe42fee4128f5a8fcab3f49e6e41) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5529420/trump-department-of-war-department-of-defense))

6/ **JD Vance defended the U.S. strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat and dismissed a war-crime accusation, saying “I don’t give a shit what you call it \[...\] Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military."** The Trump administration said the strike in international waters targeted Tren de Aragua and killed 11 suspected traffickers. Trump posted footage of the strike, warning: “Please let this serve as notice \[...\] BEWARE!” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth added that “it won’t stop with just this strike.” The Trump administration, meanwhile, hasn’t provided evidence verifying who, or what, was aboard the boat. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/06/vance-drug-strike-venezuela-00548816) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/08/puerto-rico-hegseth-cartels/) / [Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/jd-vance-snaps-at-dem-influencer-in-spat-over-potential-war-crimes-in-trump-plan-i-dont-give-a-sht-what-you-call-it/))

7/ **Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threatened to “punch” Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte “in your fucking face” during a private dinner of Trump allies**, according to five people familiar with the incident. Witnesses said Bessent accused Pulte of badmouthing him to Trump, shouting: “Why the fuck are you talking to the president about me? Fuck you. I’m gonna punch you in your fucking face.” The clash escalated until Bessent told club co-owner Omeed Malik, “It’s either me or him \[...\] we could go outside,” adding he would “fucking beat \[Pulte’s\] ass.” Malik then separated the men and seated them at opposite ends of the table. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/08/scott-bessent-bill-pulte-blowup-00549956))

* **Bill Pulte accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of fraud for claiming multiple primary residences, even as his own father and stepmother claimed the same exemptions in Michigan and Florida**. Michigan officials revoked the exemption after finding the house was rented, saying “Revised tax bills will be issued to the Pultes, including all applicable penalty and interest,” while Florida officials said the matter should be handled in Michigan. Pulte posted that “Financial fraud is a big deal. Don’t do it!” and “Lisa Cook’s declared ‘PRIMARY RESIDENCE’ is being RENTED out to tenants.” Cook, who has sued Trump over her dismissal from the Fed, denied wrongdoing, with her lawyer saying the claims were “not fraud.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-pulte-accused-fed-governor-lisa-cook-fraud-his-relatives-filed-housing-2025-09-05/) / [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-cabinet-mortgage-fraud))

8/ **U.S. employers added 22,000 jobs in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% – the highest in nearly four years – and revisions showed the economy actually lost 13,000 jobs in June**, the first monthly decline since late 2020. Job losses hit manufacturing, construction, business services, and federal government jobs, while health care accounted for most of the growth. Last month, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief and accused the agency of manipulating data after the July jobs report showed large downward revisions to May and June and a weaker outlook. He claimed the figures were “rigged to make him look bad."
