1/ **In a combative 56-minute address to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump told world leaders their countries are “going to hell,” accused the U.N. of “not even coming close to living up” to its potential, denounced climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and declared it was “time to end the failed experiment of open borders.”** Trump urged nations to abandon renewable energy, called the carbon footprint “a hoax made up by people with evil intentions,” said climate predictions were “made by stupid people,” and warned, “If you don’t get away from this green scam your country is going to fail.” Trump also accused environmentalists of wanting to “kill all the cows.” On immigration, Trump blamed the U.N. for funding an “assault on Western countries” by aiding migrants, told European leaders “You’re destroying your heritage,” and claimed “immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.” He also pressed nations to stop buying Russian energy, warned drug cartels the U.S. would “blow you out of existence,” and condemned allies who recognized Palestinian statehood as giving “a reward for Hamas terrorists.” Trump repeated his claim that he had ended seven wars and said “everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize,” despite polling showing most Americans disagree. He mocked the U.N. over a broken teleprompter and escalator, saying those were “the two things I got from the United Nations.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/politics/trump-un-aid-israel-gaza.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5517683-trump-climate-change-con-job/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/23/trump-united-nations-immigration-climate-change/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/trump-un-speech-climate-immigration) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/takeaways-trump-un-speech) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/23/trump-blasts-un-peacemaking-00576177) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-unga-trump-global-feb243ecb979d53317dfb1cad9968038) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-says-migration-and-climate-change-policies-are-destroying-western-nations-e7047e00) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-address-un-he-distances-us-global-cooperation-2025-09-23/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5546864/trump-foreign-policy-priorities-unga) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-address-un-divisions-allies-deepen-palestinian-statehood-trade-rcna233026) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/trump-un-ga-speech.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/trump-tells-un-the-us-is-the-hottest-country-in-the-world) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/climate/trump-climate-energy-united-nations-unga.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/trump-un-general-assembly-speech))

2/ **Trump abruptly reversed course and said Ukraine could “WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” calling Russia “a paper tiger.”** Trump previously called for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make territorial concessions to Russia as part of a ceasefire deal. Trump said Putin and Russia were in “BIG Economic trouble” and urged NATO allies to “shoot down” any Russian aircraft in their airspace. Trump, however, stopped short of promising U.S. involvement, saying NATO backup would “depend on the circumstance,” and it wasn’t clear if Trump meant the borders from before 2022 or also Crimea.

3/ **Health agencies worldwide rejected Trump’s "based on what I feel" claim that Tylenol use during pregnancy is linked to autism**. The European Medicines Agency said, “Available evidence has found no link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism,” and kept its guidance unchanged. The WHO said the evidence “remains inconsistent” and warned against “casual conclusions,” while also stating that “We know that vaccines do not cause autism.” The U.K., Australia, Spain, and Germany also reaffirmed existing advice that paracetamol can be used in pregnancy as needed and warned that untreated fever and pain pose risks. Spain’s health minister added that Trump’s “denialism not only destroys trust in science: it puts lives at risk.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/g-s1-90068/world-health-officials-reject-trumps-claims-that-tylenol-is-linked-to-autism) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/world-reacts-trump-link-tylenol-autism-pregnancy-safe-paracetamol-rcna233133) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5517731-eu-who-debunk-tylenol-autism-link-pregnancy/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-medicines-regulator-paracetamol-safe-be-used-during-pregnancy-2025-09-23/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/republican-senator-tylenol-autism) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/23/trump-vaccines-autism-mmr-schedule/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/23/global-health-agencies-dismiss-false-trump-claim-everyday-painkillers) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/in-targeting-a-common-painkiller-trump-oversteps-his-own-advisers-guidance-on-autism-571e9eae) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/health/fda-autism-treatment-leucovorin.html))

4/ **Trump canceled a planned White House meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries a week before the Sept. 30 government shutdown deadline**. Trump claimed Democrats’ demands were “unserious and ridiculous” and declared “no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.” Democrats wanted to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back Republican Medicaid cuts, which Trump called “Radical Left Views and Policies.” Republicans, meanwhile, advanced a stopgap bill without health care provisions that can’t pass the Senate without Democratic votes.

5/ **Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that inflation risks are rising while hiring slows**, calling it a “challenging situation” days after the Fed cut interest rates. He said monetary policy was “still modestly restrictive” and noted stocks were “fairly highly valued.” Powell also warned “the downside risks to employment have risen” and “uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fed-chair-powell-rising-inflation-slow-hiring-pose/story?id=125857000) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/economy/fed-chair-powell-rate-cuts) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/powell-says-slowing-labor-market-prompted-rate-cut-sees-challenging-situation-ahead.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/powell-reiterates-no-risk-free-path-for-fed-amid-dual-threats) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-chair-jerome-powell-speaks-rate-cuts-397ac3f7))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **A federal jury found Ryan Wesley Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club in 2024**, along with assaulting a federal officer and gun charges. Sentencing is set for Dec. 18 and he faces up to life in prison. After the verdict, Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen before marshals restrained him. Trump called the outcome “A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” and said, “This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/man-found-guilty-attempted-assassination-plot-kill-trump-florida-golf-club-2025-09-23/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ryan-routh-verdict-trump-assassination-attempt-florida-golf-course-rcna232946) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/ryan-routh-trump-attempted-assassination-guilty) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/trump-ryan-routh-trial-florida.html))

2. **House and Senate Democrats opened investigations into why the Trump administration shut down an FBI bribery probe of border czar Tom Homan**. Agents recorded Homan in 2024 accepting a bag with $50,000 and offering help with border contracts, but the Justice Department closed the case this year. Democrats demanded all recordings and records, accusing DOJ and the FBI of a “brazen cover-up to protect Donald Trump’s allies.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/us/politics/tom-homan-democrats-investigation.html))

3. **The Trump administration placed about a dozen USDA researchers and supervisors on paid leave days after canceling the government’s annual food insecurity report**. The employees, all present at meetings about the cancellation, were escorted out of their offices and had their laptops taken. Their union called it retaliation, saying “The general public deserves honesty and transparency in data and reports." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/usda-hunger-researchers-on-leave))

4. **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore more than $500 million in research grants to UCLA**, ruling the freezes “likely arbitrary and capricious” and unlawful. The administration had suspended the funding and demanded $1 billion along with policy changes to release it, a proposal UCLA said would “devastate” the school. Judge Rita Lin said the cuts were “unreasoned mass terminations,” forcing agencies to resume payments for projects including cancer and Parkinson’s research.

5. **Nexstar and Sinclair said they will keep pre-empting “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” even as Disney reinstated the show**, blocking it on more than 50 ABC affiliates – roughly a quarter of the network’s stations. Nexstar cited Kimmel’s “ill-timed and insensitive” remarks that “the MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” FCC Chair Brendan Carr had threatened to “take action” after Kimmel’s comments.
