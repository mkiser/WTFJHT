1/ **A shooter opened fire from a nearby rooftop at a Dallas ICE field office, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others**. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot. The FBI said it was investigating the incident as "an act of targeted violence" and FBI Director Kash Patel posted images of unspent shell casings, including one marked "ANTI-ICE." Investigators, however, haven’t confirmed a motive or determined whether the shooting connects to other recent threats or attacks on immigration facilities.

2/ **Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC after a weeklong suspension, defended free speech, and denied he mocked Charlie Kirk’s killing**, saying: “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.” He said the Trump administration “tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show \[...\] to take my show off the air,” adding, “That’s not legal. That’s not American, that is un-American.” ABC suspended the show after FCC Chair Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel’s jokes and warned “we can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Carr later claimed Disney made a “business decision” and denied threatening ABC stations with “remedies” and possible license revocations. Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to pre-empt the show. Trump, meanwhile, attacked Kimmel’s return, saying “I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” calling the network a “true bunch of losers.” He added, “I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/business/media/jimmy-kimmel-return-monologue.html) / [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jimmy-kimmel-returns-monologue-trump) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5551277/jimmy-kimmel-live-abc-back-on-air-glen-powell-fcc-trump) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-24/kimmel-takes-conciliatory-tone-on-return-to-abc-late-night-show) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-return-monologue-00576321) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jimmy-kimmel-responds-abc-show-indefinite-hold-rcna232128) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/trump-jimmy-kimmel-return-abc) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/5518887-trump-slams-abc-kimmel-return/))

* **Four Democratic senators opened an investigation into Nexstar and Sinclair after the companies refused to air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” following Kimmel’s remarks about the assassination of Charlie Kirk**. In a letter, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, and Chris Van Hollen pressed the companies to explain how their decisions “may relate to regulatory issues pending with the Trump administration.” They warned that if the suspensions were tied to seeking favors from regulators, it could create “the appearance of a possible quid-pro-quo arrangement that could implicate federal anti-corruption laws.” Both Nexstar and Sinclair have pending business before the FCC.

3/ **Former FBI director James Comey is expected to be indicted for allegedly lying to Congress, even though Justice Department prosecutors said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring a case**. Trump fired U.S. attorney Erik Siebert last week for refusing to prosecute Comey, and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, who is now presenting evidence to a grand jury before the statute of limitations expires next week. The case centers on Comey’s 2020 testimony, where he said he didn’t recall a Hillary Clinton referral and denied approving media leaks. Sen. Ted Cruz pointed to Andrew McCabe’s account that Comey had approved one, calling their statements “irreconcilably contradictory” and that “one of them is lying under oath – a federal crime."

4/ **Trump privately promised Arab and Muslim leaders at the U.N. that he would block Israel from annexing the West Bank**. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long opposed a Palestinian state, expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and faces pressure from far-right allies to move toward formal annexation ahead of elections. Arab leaders, however, warned Trump that such a step would collapse the Abraham Accords and end Israel’s regional integration. Trump tied his pledge on the West Bank to a separate “21-point plan” for Gaza that calls for a ceasefire, release of hostages, Israeli withdrawal, and an Arab-led postwar security force.

**⏭️ Notably Next**: *Congress has 6 days to pass a funding measure to prevent a government shutdown; and the 2026 midterms are in 405 days*.

* **✨ Well, that’s fantastic**. *Democrat Adelita Grijalva won Arizona’s 7th Congressional District special election by 42.9 points. Once sworn in, she will become the 218th signer of a bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote to release federal investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein. After she signs, House rules require at least seven legislative days before a floor vote, which could come by mid-October*.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **FBI agents said they seized “secret” and “confidential” records from John Bolton’s Washington office**, including files on weapons of mass destruction and U.N. matters. The search warrant cited potential Espionage Act violations. Bolton’s lawyer Abbe Lowell called them “ordinary records” from decades past and said “nothing inappropriate was stored or kept.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/23/fbi-classified-documents-john-bolton-dc-office-00577894) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/24/fbi-investigation-documents-john-bolton/))

2. **Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving a deal to move TikTok’s U.S. operations into a new company with American investors**. ByteDance would keep under 20% ownership, while Oracle would store U.S. user data and monitor the algorithm. Trump said Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and the Murdoch family will be involved, calling them “really great people, very prominent people” and “American patriots.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-will-sign-tiktok-deal-thursday-source-says-2025-09-24/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tiktok-deal-sale-china-rcna233524))

A U.N. official also said the White House was responsible for Trump’s broken teleprompter.

5. **U.S. Park Police removed a 12-foot statue of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein from the National Mall**, saying it was “not in compliance with the permit.” The piece, titled “Best Friends Forever,” showed the two holding hands with a plaque that read: “We celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J. Trump and his ‘closest friend’ Jeffrey Epstein.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/24/trump-epstein-statue-removed-dc-national-mall/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/us/politics/trump-epstein-statue-dc-national-mall.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/trump-epstein-statue-dc-national-mall))
