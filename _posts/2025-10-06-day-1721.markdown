1/ **Illinois and Chicago sued to block Trump’s deployment of 300 federalized National Guard troops to the city**, calling the order “patently unlawful” and “unconstitutional.” A federal judge, however, declined to stop the deployment, allowing 200 Texas Guard troops to move toward Illinois as part of the operation. Gov. JB Pritzker called the mobilization “an unconstitutional invasion” and said the administration’s “plan all along has been to cause chaos.” Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Trump “failed to establish any legal basis” for deploying troops, while the White House claimed he acted lawfully “to protect federal officers and assets” amid “violent riots and lawlessness.” Chicago police data, however, shows violent crime and murders have fallen sharply this year.

2/ **Federal agents shot and wounded a woman in Chicago after what Homeland Security said was a ramming and boxing-in of a law-enforcement vehicle**. Officials said she was armed with a semiautomatic weapon. The shooting follows a week of federal raids that detained 37 people, including U.S. citizens and separated children. Gov. JB Pritzker said federal forces were “making it a war zone” and ordered a state investigation into reports of abuse during the raids. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, meanwhile, defended the crackdown, calling Chicago a “war zone” that had taken “a thousand criminals off the streets.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/border-patrol-agents-shoot-woman-chicago-protesters-confront-immigration-2025-10-04/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/us/chicago-apartment-ice-raid) / [Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/04/shooting-involving-federal-agents-in-brighton-park-under-investigation) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2025/10/03/ice-raid-chicago-apartment-building-aftermath-photos/86499681007/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/04/us/federal-agent-shooting-chicago.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/05/trump-kristi-noem-chicago-national-guard) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/us/politics/pritzker-chicago-immigration.html))

3/ **The Trump administration offered unaccompanied migrant children in federal custody a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily leave the U.S.** DHS said the payment would apply to children 14 and older in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, exclude Mexicans, and be issued only “after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,” with ICE calling it a “strictly voluntary option to return home to their families.” ICE said the rollout would start with 17-year-olds. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, meanwhile, issued a temporary restraining order blocking ICE from transferring “age-outs” to adult detention in violation of a 2021 injunction. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration-offering-unaccompanied-migrant-children-2500-self-rcna235574) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/04/immigrant-children-ice-detention-ruling) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/04/ice-minors-detention-deportation-00594267) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/dhs-offering-2500-stipend-unaccompanied-migrant-children-deport/story?id=126200603) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/politics/unaccompanied-migrant-kids-payments) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-immigration-migrant-teens-2500-self-deportation/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/us-to-offer-migrant-teenagers-2-500-to-voluntarily-return-home) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ice-immigration-orr-shelters-b855b5a03a6be3ba62662a5999a5984f))

4/ **A federal judge blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops from any state into Oregon, expanding an earlier order that said he lacked legal authority to federalize Oregon’s own Guard**. The decision came after the administration deployed about 200 California National Guard members to Portland despite that first ruling, which the judge called “a direct contravention” of her order. California and Oregon sued to stop the deployment, accusing the administration of abusing its authority. “The rule of law has prevailed – and California’s National Guard will soon be heading home,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said, while Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek added: “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security.”  ([The Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/10/judge-issues-new-broader-order-barring-any-national-guard-from-being-relocating-to-oregon.html) / [Sacramento Bee](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article312391589.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/06/trump-sued-california-oregon-national-guard-troops) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/05/national-guard-oregon-california-rurling-00594606) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/national-guard-oregon-california-trump-newsom-3b8e12f8d2d39f195dda73dda31f1681) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/us/trump-national-guard-california-oregon-newsom.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/california-troops-sent-to-oregon-after-court-bars-oregon-guard-deployment-5545de00) / [Democracy Docket](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/newsom-sue-trump-california-national-guard-portland-oregon/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/10/05/chicago-portland-protests-trump-national-guard/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/oregon-national-guard-trump-ruling-portland-hnk) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/judge-temporarily-blocks-use-national-guard-portland-rcna235664) /  [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/06/trump-california-national-guard-oregon-portland-newsom))

5/ **The Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with ending Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans**, pausing U.S. District Judge Edward Chen’s ruling that said the administration acted improperly. In a brief order, the justices wrote, “The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.” The three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing: “I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-trump-revoke-tps-immigration-venezuelans-rcna234537) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/03/supreme-court-temporary-protected-status/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/03/supreme-court-trump-deportation-protections-venezuelan-migrants/86440007007/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-venezuela-immigrants-e0277e3b373818945f50a48bc71b8583) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/03/trump-venezuela-deportations-supreme-court-ruling))

* **The Supreme Court new term will focus on Trump’s expansion of presidential power, including cases on tariffs, agency firings, and ending birthright citizenship**. The justices have repeatedly backed Trump through more than 20 emergency orders with little explanation, leading Justice Sonia Sotomayor to say his administration “has the Supreme Court on speed dial.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-executive-power-lgbtq-voting-98285156a1279b2ff7fe15b8d96eef37) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5558414/supreme-court-term-preview) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/us/politics/supreme-court-presidential-power.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-returns-major-tests-ahead-trumps-presidential/story?id=126130571) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/john-roberts-donald-trump-supreme-court-00594600))
* **A fire destroyed the South Carolina home of Judge Diane Goodstein shortly after she blocked a Trump administration request for state voter data**. Three family members were hospitalized after escaping the fire, which investigators say followed an “explosion.” Authorities haven’t determined whether the fire was accidental or arson, and the judge had recently reported receiving death threats. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/judge-diane-goodstein-home-fire-investigation))

6/ **Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired a whistle-blower three weeks after she filed a complaint alleging the Trump administration defied court orders and undermined vaccine research**. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had been placed on leave in March and said she was punished for defending vaccine science, saying her dismissal showed the administration “does not share my commitment to scientific integrity and public health.” Her lawyer called the firing “retaliatory.” Kennedy cited his authority to make the termination but gave no reason, while HHS called Marrazzo’s claims “false.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/health/kennedy-marrazzo-nih.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-fires-nih-vaccine-whistleblower-dr-jeanne-marrazzo/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/rfk-jr-jeanne-marrazzo-nih-fired))

* **The CDC approved new vaccine guidance that scales back federal recommendations for Covid and childhood shots**, following directives from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Trump. Acting Director Jim O’Neill said “informed consent is back,” as the agency dropped universal Covid vaccination for older adults and limited access to a combined measles and chickenpox shot. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/06/cdc-rfk-jr-vaccine-recommendations-schedule) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/cdc-endorses-vaccine-panel-changes-to-covid-mmrv-shot-recommendations-00594763) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-signs-fall-covid-shots-may-not-easy-get-one-depending-live-rcna233418))

7/ **The Supreme Court rejected Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal, keeping her conviction and 20-year sentence for recruiting and grooming girls abused by Jeffrey Epstein**. Maxwell argued that a 2008 nonprosecution deal in Florida should have protected her from trial in New York, but Solicitor General D. John Sauer called that claim “incorrect,” saying the agreement applied only within Florida. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also rejected her argument earlier. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/us/politics/supreme-court-ghislaine-maxwell-epstein-appeal.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-supreme-court-appeal-epstein) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/06/ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-epstein-supreme-court/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-epstein-associate-ghislaine-maxwells-appeal-crim-rcna233281))

8/ **The Treasury Department said it was considering a $1 Trump coin to mark the nation’s 250th anniversary next year**. A draft image of the proposed coin shows Trump’s profile on one side and a raised-fist with “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” on the other. A Treasury spokesperson said a final design hadn’t been selected, but the “first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy.” A 2020 law authorizes $1 coins for 2026, but says “no head and shoulders portrait or bust” and “no portrait of a living person” may appear on the reverse. Federal code also limits currency portraits to the deceased.

9/ **House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries challenged Speaker Mike Johnson to a live debate on the sixth day of the government shutdown**, proposing to meet “any day this week in primetime” to give Americans “the transparency they deserve” and allow Johnson to explain his “my way or the highway approach.” Johnson, however, dismissed the invitation as “nonsense” and accused Jeffries of making “desperate pleas for attention.” Johnson noted that the House already debated before passing its stopgap funding bill, which the Senate has repeatedly failed to advance. The House remains out of session this week while the Senate prepares for another vote expected to fail Monday evening.

poll/ **52% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the government shutdown**. 52% also disapprove of congressional Republicans and 49% disapprove of Democrats. 39% blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, 30% blame Democrats, and 31% blame both equally. The most common word Americans use to describe Democrats is “weak,” while “extreme” is the top descriptor for Republicans.
