1/ **Trump threatened to use the ongoing government shutdown, now in its ninth day, to make permanent cuts to “Democrat programs,”** after already freezing or canceling billions in climate and infrastructure funding for Democratic-led states. “We’re only cutting Democrat programs,” he said, adding, “They wanted to do this so we will give them a little taste of their own medicine.” The White House is also weighing mass layoffs and said furloughed workers may not receive back pay. Nearly all federal employees will be furloughed Monday for Columbus Day without pay, as the IRS and Interior Department reversed earlier guidance promising compensation. Military members are also set to miss their first paycheck next week, as Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to hold a vote on a standalone troop pay bill, saying Democrats must pass the Republican stopgap measure. The Senate, meanwhile, again rejected competing funding bills as Democrats demanded an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune ruled out ending the filibuster, Marjorie Taylor Greene continued to blame Republican leaders for the shutdown, and senior Republicans warned Trump against deep cuts.

2/ **U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked Trump from deploying or federalizing National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days**. Perry said she found “no credible evidence that there is the danger of rebellion in Illinois” and called Homeland Security’s assessment of events “simply unreliable.” The judge said federal claims of escalating violence contradicted reports from state and local law enforcement and warned that militarizing the response “will lead to civil unrest.” Illinois and Chicago had sued, arguing Trump’s deployment violated the Constitution and state sovereignty. Trump, meanwhile, claimed the move was necessary to protect federal agents and property.

3/ **Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan resolution to limit Trump’s authority to order military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean**. The measure would have required congressional approval for further attacks. It failed 51–48. The Trump administration has carried out at least four strikes since September, killing 21 people, and declared that the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartel despite not providing Congress with “hard evidence” the boats carried drugs.

4/ **Trump tried to privately message Attorney General Pam Bondi on social media to demand she prosecute his political opponents, but instead he posted it publicly**. On [Sept. 20](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2025/09/22/day-1707/#1-trump-demanded-that-attorney-gener), Trump urged "Pam" to prosecute his political rivals, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying “We can’t delay any longer \[...\] JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” Five days later, prosecutors indicted Comey. Before the indictment, Trump forced out the U.S. attorney in Virginia who declined to charge Comey and installed his former personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72))

5/ **A federal grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a civil fraud judgment against Trump last year, on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution**. Lindsey Halligan, the newly installed U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, presented the case after Trump publicly demanded James be charged. James called the case “baseless” and “a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system.” Career prosecutors had previously concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge James. Nevertheless, Halligan said, “No one is above the law,” calling the alleged conduct “tremendous breaches of the public’s trust.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-appointed-prosecutor-seeks-indictment-new-york-ag/story?id=126378516) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/09/us/trump-news) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/justice-department-secures-indictment-of-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-0cc2ce4f) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/09/letitia-james-grand-jury-trump/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/letitia-james-fraud-justice-department-donald-trump-41d8746d4674f2be42d667647089b213) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/09/trump-letitia-james-indicted) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-trump-opponent-indicted-grand-jury-b-rcna236737))

6/ **EARLIER: Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump’s Gaza peace plan**, pausing the two-year ~~war~~ genocide that began after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages taken to Gaza, and Israel’s subsequent military campaign that’s killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, displaced nearly all 2 million residents, and destroyed most homes, hospitals, schools, and basic infrastructure across the territory. Trump said the deal means “ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon” and that Israeli troops will withdraw “to an agreed upon line.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a great day for Israel” and said the government will vote to ratify the agreement, while Hamas urged Trump to ensure Israel withdraws its forces and allow aid into Gaza “without disavowal or delay.” The agreement, however, leaves key issues unresolved, including Hamas’ disarmament and who will govern Gaza.

7/ **Trump’s push for a Gaza ceasefire came as he publicly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, prompting concern in Norway that he could retaliate if he doesn’t win**. Trump said, “Nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months, and I’ve stopped eight wars,” and added, “If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds.” The White House called him “The Peace President.” The Norwegian Nobel Committee, meanwhile, said it made its decision Monday – before the ceasefire – and that the Gaza ceasefire would count toward next year’s prize. Norwegian leaders said they were “prepared for anything,” including new tariffs or new NATO demands.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Twenty-two states are in or near recession**, according to Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, who said many households are “hanging on by their fingertips.” The downturn is concentrated in agriculture- and manufacturing-heavy states hit by tariffs, immigration limits, and federal job cuts. Zandi warned that if California or New York slip from “treading water” into contraction, “the nation’s going into recession.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/09/trump-tariffs-immigration-recession-states) / [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/10/09/america-feels-recession-state-dependent-income-cohort-moody-zandi/))

2. **China imposed new export controls on rare earths and related technologies**, materials vital to U.S. defense and tech industries. The rules require foreign firms to get Beijing’s approval to export products containing 0.1% or more of China-sourced rare earths, with military-related licenses generally denied. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/china-imposes-new-controls-over-rare-earth-exports-35a4b106) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/09/g-s1-92685/china-curbs-rare-earth-exports-raising-stakes-before-trump-xi-talks) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/china-outlines-controls-exports-rare-earths-technology-rcna236712) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/how-china-s-rare-earths-dominance-is-leverage-in-trump-s-trade-war))

3. **Nearly a quarter of FBI agents have been reassigned to immigration enforcement**, diverting thousands from counterterrorism, cybercrime, and other investigations. Some large field offices now devote nearly 40% of agents to helping ICE locate and arrest migrants. Former officials called the shift “a misuse of exquisite ability,” while Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed it was needed to “keep Americans safe.”([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/08/fbi-agents-reassigned-immigration/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/08/trump-ice-immigration-kash-patel-fbi))

4. **Dominion Voting Systems was sold to Liberty Vote, a new company run by former Republican election official Scott Leiendecker**, who said he aims to “restore public confidence” in U.S. elections. The rebranded firm plans to emphasize paper ballots and outside audits, aligning with Trump’s calls for voting changes under an executive order partly blocked by federal courts. Election experts said the move “raises a lot of questions” for states that still use Dominion machines. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/dominion-voting-systems-bought-election-ballots) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/09/dominion-voting-machines-sold-elections) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/dominion-voting-system-sold.html))

5. **The Democratic National Committee delayed its report on the 2024 loss until after November’s state elections, putting off accountability for how Trump defeated Harris**. Early briefings blamed late spending and weak economic messaging, but avoided bringing up Biden’s withdrawal and age. Chair Ken Martin, meanwhile, said revisiting those issues “doesn’t help me win elections,” drawing criticism from frustrated Democrats demanding accountability.
