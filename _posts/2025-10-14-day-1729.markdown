1/ **Trump threatened to permanently cut more ‚ÄúDemocrat programs‚Äù as the government shutdown entered its third week**, promising to name the ‚Äúmost egregious, socialist, semi-communist‚Äù programs for elimination on Friday. He said Democrats are ‚Äúgetting killed‚Äù and that the targets would ‚Äúnever going to open again.‚Äù Speaker Mike Johnson backed Trump and dared Democrats to ‚Äúbring it‚Äù and challenge the moves in court. Meanwhile, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, breaking with her party, called House Republicans ‚Äúweak men‚Äù who mishandled the shutdown and were ‚Äúafraid of strong Republican women.‚Äù She said Johnson and other Republican leaders had sidelined conservative women while ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù men who refuse to challenge the leadership. The Office of Management and Budget said it would ‚Äúbatten down the hatches,‚Äù continue layoffs, and keep paying troops and law enforcement.

2/ **North Carolina‚Äôs Republican legislative leaders will vote next week to redraw the state‚Äôs U.S. House map to add a Republican-leaning seat**. State House Speaker Destin Hall said, ‚ÄúPresident Trump earned a clear mandate \[...\] and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat.‚Äù Republicans currently hold 10 of North Carolina‚Äôs 14 U.S. House seats. The move follows Texas‚Äôs passage of a map adding five Republican-leaning seats and California‚Äôs pending voter referendum on a Democratic-favored map, while Missouri‚Äôs revised map intended to help Republicans pick up an additional seat faces court challenges. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/13/north-carolina-redistricting-map-trump/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-congress-redistricting-house-b32b6b1c52d9f59efac41c3b8c0db971) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/us/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/north-carolina-republicans-announce-plans-vote-new-congressional-map-rcna237411) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5553592-nc-republicans-redrawing-congressional-map/) / [Democracy Docket](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/north-carolina-is-latest-gop-controlled-state-to-announce-a-gerrymander/))

3/ **The Supreme Court will rehear a major voting rights case that could limit how race is used in drawing election maps**. The case, Louisiana v. Callais, asks whether Louisiana violated the 14th and 15th Amendments by creating a second majority-Black district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana and the Trump administration argued that ‚Äúrace-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our Constitution‚Äù and claimed Section 2 of the law has become ‚Äúelectoral race-based affirmative action.‚Äù Courts had earlier ruled that Louisiana‚Äôs original map diluted the power of Black voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act  and ordered lawmakers to draw a second majority-Black district. A federal court later blocked that new map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-conservatives) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/14/supreme-court-voting-rights-black-louisiana/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/voting-rights-act-cutbacks-weighed-by-supreme-court-in-louisiana-case) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/supreme-court-voting-rights-act.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-voting-rights-race-louisiana-348260f08099d087bcde4a93140aa8b2) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-voting-rights-louisiana-v-callais-congressional-map/))

* **üîé What's at Stake?** If the Supreme Court weakens Section 2, the main federal check on maps that dilute minority votes would be rolled back. States could then stop drawing or preserving majority-Black and Latino districts, allowing legislatures to split those communities up, and reduce their ability to elect preferred candidates while leaving fewer federal tools to police racially biased maps.

4/ **The U.S. military killed six more people in a strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela** ‚Äì the fifth such operation since September. Trump claimed that the vessel was ‚Äúaffiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization‚Äù and ‚Äúintelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics.‚Äù He said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the ‚Äúlethal kinetic strike‚Äù in international waters and that no U.S. troops were harmed. Despite having killed at least 27 people so far, the Trump administration hasn‚Äôt provided evidence that the boats were carrying drugs or linked to terrorist groups. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5554958-trump-us-military-venezuela-strike/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-venezuela-boat-strike-c4130a61) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/us/politics/trump-drugs-boat-attack.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/trump-six-killed-us-strike-boat-venezuela) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/trump-says-boat-strike-off-venezuela-kills-6-accused-traffickers) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cartels-drugs-venezuela-boat-strike-af1a784864268707a76755a98615563e) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-conducts-lethal-strike-alleged-drug-boat-off/story?id=126520481) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/politics/us-boat-strike-venezuela) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/14/trump-drug-boat-venezuela/))

5/ **Nearly every major U.S. news outlet refused to sign the Pentagon‚Äôs new press access policy, saying it ‚Äúundermines the First Amendment.‚Äù** The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, Fox News, ABC, CBS, NBC, Reuters, the Associated Press, and Newsmax (!) said the rules would restrict their ability to report freely on the U.S. military. The 21-page policy requires journalists to acknowledge that they won‚Äôt seek or publish information not approved by the Defense Department, including unclassified material, or risk losing credentials. ‚ÄúThe policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections,‚Äù the five major broadcast networks said in a joint statement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, defended the rules as ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and posted a hand-waving emoji to several outlets on Twitter/X after their refusals. Only One America News said it had signed.

6/ **Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed would likely cut rates again this month as job growth continued to slow and key data remained unavailable during the shutdown**. ‚ÄúThere is no risk-free path for policy,‚Äù Powell said, admitting that the Fed ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be able to replace the data we‚Äôre not getting.‚Äù The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, said Trump‚Äôs tariffs were weighing on global growth, warning of ‚Äúincreasing signs that the adverse effects of protectionist measures are starting to show.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/business/powell-fed-inflation-jobs-tension) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/powell-keeps-fed-on-track-to-lower-rates-again-a2e9b065) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/trump-tariffs-ai-imf-economy) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/imf-report-economy-trade-inflation.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/powell-signals-another-cut-as-weak-hiring-pressures-unemployment))

1. **Trump posthumously awarded Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom** on what would have been the activist‚Äôs 32nd birthday, calling him a ‚Äúfearless warrior for liberty‚Äù and ‚Äúmartyr for freedom.‚Äù The ceremony came a month after Kirk was fatally shot at a Utah college. Erika Kirk accepted the medal on behalf of her husband, saying the honor was ‚Äúthe best birthday gift he could ever have.‚Äù ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/charlie-kirk-presidential-medal-of-freedom-trump) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-presidential-medal-of-freedom-f895a361c5c1d2663cacd64082bb5ed7) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-awards-charlie-kirk-presidential-medal-of-freedom/))

Some of the leaked messages also echoed Charlie Kirk‚Äôs past rhetoric, including a comment about a dark-skinned pilot that closely resembled Kirk‚Äôs own remark questioning the qualifications of Black pilots.

5. **Trump attacked Time magazine for using what he called ‚Äúthe Worst of All Time‚Äù photo on its cover featuring his Gaza peace deal**. He claimed editors ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù his hair and made it look like a ‚Äúfloating crown,‚Äù saying the image ‚Äúdeserves to be called out.‚Äù Russia, meanwhile, also condemned the photo, calling the editors ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù and ‚Äúfreaks.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/14/trump-time-magazine-cover/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-slams-freaks-time-magazine-donald-trump-cover-photo/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/time-magazine-cover-trump-israel-gaza) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5554167-trump-criticizes-time-magazine-cover/))
