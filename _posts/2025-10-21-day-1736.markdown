1/ **A man pardoned by Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 riot was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries**. Authorities said Christopher Moynihan sent text messages stating, “I cannot allow this terrorist to live” and “I will kill him for the future,” referring to an event Jeffries was scheduled to attend in New York City. Police said the FBI received an anonymous tip warning of Moynihan’s “homicidal ideations” and drug abuse before his arrest. Jeffries called Moynihan “a dangerous individual” and blamed Trump’s “reckless blanket pardon” for forcing police “to keep our communities safe from violent individuals who should never have been pardoned.” Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, called the threat “terrible” but repeated that “violence on the left is far more prevalent than the violence on the right,” even though federal and academic [data](https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367) show right-wing violence has been more frequent and more lethal since 2001.

2/ **Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel “is not going to pass” following reports that Paul Ingrassia sent text messages that the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell” and admitted he has “a Nazi streak.”** Thune suggested that the White House should withdraw him with Republican Sens. Rick Scott, Ron Johnson, and James Lankford saying they would vote no, short of the votes needed to advance.   Ingrassia’s attorney, meanwhile, questioned the messages’ authenticity and called them “self-deprecating and satirical humor.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/john-thune-says-trump-nominee-paul-ingrassia-wont-get-confirmed-osc-rcna238787) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/20/2025/republicans-set-to-reject-trump-nominee-ingrassia) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/21/congress/john-thune-paul-ingrassia-hearing-00616569) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/paul-ingrassia-trump-nominee-716b875f) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/21/paul-ingrassia-trump-texts-senate-confirmation) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/paul-ingrassia-trump-senate.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ingrassia-trump-nomination-republicans-316acf5f76153521d10c4e5410929fcf))

* **The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions plans to hold a confirmation hearing next Thursday for Trump’s nominee for surgeon general**. Trump said he nominated Casey Means in May after withdrawing his first pick, Janette Nesheiwat, because “Bobby thought she was fantastic,” referring to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While Means earned an MD from Stanford, she dropped out of her residency after becoming “disillusioned” with the health care system and instead persued a career as a “wellness influencer.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/senate-plans-confirmation-hearing-for-surgeon-general-nominee) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-plans-hearing-trumps-surgeon-general-pick-casey/story?id=126729714))

3/ **Trump demanded that the Justice Department he now oversees pay him about $230 million for federal investigations into him, including probes of Russian election interference and the 2022 Mar-a-Lago search**. Trump claimed he “was damaged very greatly" by "malicious prosecution” and that "any money I would get, I would give to charity.” The claims are being reviewed by department officials who previously served as his defense lawyers, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. “I’m sort of suing myself,” Trump said, adding that “it sort of looks bad” because approving the payout “would have to go across my desk.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html))

* **Trump fired the inspector general of the Export-Import Bank**, making Parisa Salehi the latest of roughly two dozen watchdogs he has dismissed or sidelined. Senator Charles Grassley said Trump “hasn’t told Congress he was firing the Ex-Im Inspector General,” calling the move a violation of federal law. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-inspectors-general.html))

4/ **Republican lawmakers in North Carolina approved a new congressional map designed to give the Republicans an additional U.S. House seat**. The plan would likely give Republicans control of 11 of the state’s 14 seats. Democrats called the move “beyond the pale” and said it dismantled Black communities for partisan gain. The state House is expected to approve the map later this week, and Governor Josh Stein cannot veto redistricting, leaving legal challenges as the only recourse.

5/ **Republican farm-state senators and major rancher groups called Trump’s idea to import more Argentine beef to lower U.S. prices a “betrayal of America first principles,”** warning it would hurt producers. “Bottom line: if the goal is addressing beef prices at the grocery store, this isn’t the way,” Sen. Deb Fischer said. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the goal is to cut grocery costs, while ranch groups including the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the plan “does nothing to lower prices.” Argentina supplies about 2% of U.S. beef imports. Trump defended the idea, saying, “We would buy some beef from Argentina \[...\] that will bring our beef prices down,” and argued, “Argentina is fighting for its life.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/21/congress/republican-senators-trump-argentina-beef-imports-00616712) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/beef-prices-cattle-imports-trump-argentina-9f8e9efd6e74e958c586ea1e32797ba2) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/trump-argentina-beef-republican-fischer.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/us/politics/trump-argentina-beef.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/us-plans-to-open-land-for-cattle-ranching-as-beef-prices-soar))

6/ **The White House said there are “no plans” for Trump to meet Putin “in the immediate future,”** reversing last week’s announcement of a Budapest summit would happen “within two weeks or so.” Trump said he didn’t want “a wasted meeting” and would “see what happens.” White House claimed that a “productive” call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made an in-person meeting “not necessary.” The Kremlin, however, said “you can’t postpone what was not scheduled” and called for “serious preparation.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/plans-trump-putin-meet-immediate-future-white-house/story?id=126724724) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/trump-putin-summit-uncertain-00616500) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/white-house-plays-down-prospects-for-quick-putin-trump-meeting) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/21/trump-putin-summit-on-hold-russia-ukraine-war) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/trump-putin-meeting-possible-delay-russia-ukraine) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/21/russia-ukraine-trump-peace-putin-ceasefire/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-trump-1f22a02dda9adff079383370ee69f95c) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-putin-ukraine-meeting.html))

7/ **The Treasury Department told employees not to share photos of the White House East Wing demolition or construction on Trump’s ballroom**. A Treasury spokesman said photos could “potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details.” Demolition started Monday, and the White House has said the new ballroom will be about 90,000 square feet with seating for more than 650 and funded by private donors.
