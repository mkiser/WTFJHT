1/ **Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes sued the House in federal court to force Speaker Mike Johnson to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva**, who won a Sept. 23 special election. The filing claims Johnson lacks authority to delay and asked a judge to let “any person authorized by law” administer the oath if he refuses. Johnson called the suit “patently absurd,” said “We run the House,” and argued he was following a “Pelosi precedent” to wait until regular session or the shutdown ends. Democrats said Johnson has delayed swearing-in Grijalva to block the 218th signature needed for a discharge petition to release Jeffrey Epstein files.

2/ **Trump told Republicans to “hold the line” on the government shutdown, saying “We will not be extorted” and that he would meet Democratic leaders “only” after they vote to reopen the government**. Democrats have tied reopening the government to extending enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, while Republicans insist that talks can only happen after voting to fund the government. The nonpartisan health policy group KFF estimates that premiums will rise 18% on average, with the typical marketplace consumer paying $1,904 next year, up from $888. Meanwhile, 13 vulnerable House Republicans urged Speaker Mike Johnson to address the credits “immediately” after reopening. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said public pressure would make it “readily apparent” why Congress must extend the credits now.

* poll/ **59% of Americans say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about rising health care costs in the next year**. About 4 in 10 are worried they won’t be able to afford needed care, access services, or keep their insurance. 80% say health care is “extremely” or “very” important to them personally, placing it alongside the economy as a top national concern.

3/ **✨ Well, that’s fantastic**: *Sen. Jeff Merkley spoke for more than 18 hours on the Senate floor, accusing Trump of “shredding our Constitution” and acting as an authoritarian. The Oregon Democrat said “tyranny has already arrived” as he protested Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago and the indictments of Trump’s political opponents. The speech came on day 22 of the government shutdown. Republicans dismissed the marathon speech as political theater*. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/senator-jeff-merkley-floor-speech-trump) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jeff-merkley-senate-floor-speech) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/merkley-floor-speech-shutdown-trump-democrats-c75e71aaabd642c547179f7174a009fd) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-us-senator-merkley-gives-marathon-speech-opposing-trump-agenda-2025-10-22/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jeff-merkley-marathon-floor-speech-protest-senate-trump-rcna239096))

4/ **North Carolina’s Republican Legislature approved a new U.S. House map designed to add one Republican seat**, with the House voting 66-48 a day after the Senate passed it. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein can’t veto redistricting, and the map will take effect for the 2026 elections. Trump, meanwhile, praised the “improved” map and said it would “give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-congress-redistricting-trump-5dccfdf94253efb56c59bbb3d3e3a6d8) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/21/nx-s1-5577000/north-carolina-redistricting-trump) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/north-carolina-new-house-district-gop-gerrymander-00618225) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/north-carolina-lawmakers-pass-new-map-designed-give-gop-extra-house-se-rcna238702))

5/ **The U.S. military carried out its eighth strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel**, hitting a boat off Colombia in the Pacific Ocean for the first time. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed two people were killed and claimed the vessel was operated by a “designated terrorist organization” carrying narcotics. He offered no evidence beyond a video showing the vessel engulfed in flames. The attack, ordered by Trump, expands a campaign that has killed at least 34 people since Sept. 2. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-drug-boat-strike-colombia.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-strikes-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-10-22/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-strikes-8th-drug-vessel-pacific-side/))

6/ **Trump will host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House in November**. It will be the crown prince’s first U.S. visit since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded he likely ordered. Officials said the trip could produce a defense cooperation deal enacted by executive order, along with agreements on trade, artificial intelligence, nuclear energy, and security.

7/ **The White House began demolishing the entire East Wing for Trump’s planned ballroom before submitting construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission**. A senior administration official said the tear-down should be finished this weekend and that full demolition was “cheaper and more structurally sound” than building an addition. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, meanwhile, warned that the 90,000-square-foot project “will overwhelm the White House itself” and must undergo “legally required” public review. The White House dismissed objections as “manufactured outrage” and said it would submit construction plans “soon.” ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/white-house-trump-new-ballroom-demolition) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/east-wing-white-house-demolition-trump.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/historic-preservation-group-ballroom-white-house/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-says-it-will-submit-ballroom-plans-review-with-demolition-already-2025-10-22/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/21/white-house-continues-east-wing-demolition-amid-cries-trump-overreach/))

poll/ **62% of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction**, including 92% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 24% of Republicans. 65% say the economy and the federal government’s functioning are going in the wrong direction, and 60% say the same about U.S. foreign policy. 56% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, including two-thirds of independents.
