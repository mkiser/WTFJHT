1/ **The Senate rejected two bills to pay federal workers during the shutdown, which is now in its 23rd day**. Workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week. Democrats insist on negotiating Affordable Care Act subsidy extensions before reopening, while Republicans have maintained that talks could only start after funding passes. Trump, meanwhile, 57 cumulative shutdown days across his two terms set a new record surpassing Jimmy Carter’s 56 days.

2/ **At least 25 states warned that food aid benefits will stop in November if the federal government shutdown continues**. The Agriculture Department ordered states to suspend Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments “until further notice,” affecting over 42 million recipients. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that without a deal to reopen the government, benefits will “go away” by Nov. 1.

3/ **Trump called off a planned “surge” of federal immigration agents in San Francisco after a late-night calls with Mayor Daniel Lurie and tech executives**. Trump said that “friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward” and said Lurie “asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around.” Lurie confirmed that Trump “told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco.” The reversal came hours after agents began stagging at a Coast Guard base in Alameda, where police used flash-bang grenades on protesters blocking the entrance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Trump had “finally, for once, listened to reason.” ([CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/10/trump-cancels-san-francisco-immigration-surge/) / [San Francisco Standard](https://sfstandard.com/2025/10/23/lurie-trump-calls-off-federal-surge-san-francisco/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/23/trump-calls-off-surge-san-francisco-00620429) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2025/10/23/trump-san-francisco-immigration-crime-crackdown) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/san-francisco-federal-immigration-operation) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-enforcement-san-francisco-e6729ae2d696cdc881003efa1966a3d2) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/trump-backs-off-sending-federal-agents-to-san-francisco-ed4803f2) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/san-francisco-trump-federal-deployment.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-san-francisco-troops-rcna239409)) 

4/ **Virginia Democrats plan to call a special legislative session to redraw the state’s congressional map in an effort to add up to three Democratic seats**. The move would make Virginia the second state, after California, where Democrats are attempting to counter Trump’s redistricting effort before the 2026 midterm elections. “We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell said. The proposed changes would take the form of a constitutional amendment, requiring approval in consecutive legislative sessions and a voter referendum. Republicans called the plan “a desperate move." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/virginia-democrats-plan-redraw-states-congressional-maps-rcna239379) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/us/politics/virginia-democrats-redistrict.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/23/virginia-redistricting-democrats-trump/))

5/ **House Democrats opened an investigation into Trump’s demand that the Justice Department pay him $230 million for past criminal investigations**, including the Russia probe and the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago search. Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin and Oversight ranking member Robert Garcia requested all related Justice Department records, correspondence, and internal analyses by Oct. 30. The lawmakers wrote that Trump’s plan to direct Treasury funds to himself was “an outrageous and shocking attempt to shake down the American people,” and cited the Constitution’s ban on presidential payments beyond salary.

6/ **The U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion, the fastest $1 trillion increase in history outside the pandemic**. Interest payments are now the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, projected to hit $14 trillion in the next decade. While the Trump administration claims it cut the deficit by $350 billion this year, economists say shutdown costs and rising interest rates are worsening the country’s finances.

7/ **Trump pardoned the Binance founder who promoted the Trump family’s meme coin and crypto venture**, World Liberty Financial. Earlier this year, Changpeng Zhao and Binance promoted the Trumps’ USD1 token and facilitated a $2 billion investment in the coin. Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to money-laundering and served four months in prison, while Binance paid a $4.3 billion penalty. The White House, nevertheless, said Trump “exercised his constitutional authority” and declared, “The Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-binance-changpeng-zhao-pardon-7509bd63) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/binance-s-token-surges-after-founder-zhao-is-pardoned-by-trump) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/technology/trump-pardons-cz-binance.html) / [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/202183/donald-trump-pardons-cryptocurrency-ally))

* **Meteora executives were accused of running a “pump-and-dump” scheme tied to Melania Trump’s $MELANIA coin**, which spiked to $13.73 before crashing to 10 cents. Investors said the defendants used her name as “window dressing” while secretly buying and reselling the coin for profit. Melania Trump wasn’t named in the lawsuit. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/melania-trump-cryptocurrency-lawsuit))

8/ **Russia denounced Trump’s sanctions on its top oil companies, calling them “an unfriendly act” and warning that they would damage U.S.-Russia relations**. Putin said the penalties on Rosneft and Lukoil were “serious,” but claimed they wouldn’t “significantly impact our economic well-being.” Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, called the move “an act of war,” while Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow had built “strong immunity” to Western pressure. The Trump administration imposed the sanctions after canceling a planned summit with Putin and demanding an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.
