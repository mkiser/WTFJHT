1/ **The Trump administration will stop providing food assistance on Nov. 1 for about 42 million Americans** after deciding not to use emergency funds to continue the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown. SNAP has never before lapsed during a shutdown. The Agriculture Department said “the well has run dry,” blaming Senate Democrats for the lapse, and confirmed that states won’t be reimbursed if they cover the costs. Officials said the $5–$6 billion in contingency funds are reserved for disasters and “not legally available” for regular benefits. Several governors have declared emergencies to keep aid flowing, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the move “a disgusting dereliction of duty.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/27/government-shutdown-snap-food-banks) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-department-agriculture-says-no-food-aid-benefits-will-be-issued-next-month-2025-10-26/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/us/food-banks-snap-shutdown-hunger-trump.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/food-aid-government-shutdown-snap-trump-democrats-8a52a63b26a707ea676962226b090bb1) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/usda-blames-democrats-snap-benefits-lapse-new-message-website-shutdown-rcna239835) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-26/us-transport-chief-warns-of-more-shutdown-linked-flight-delays) / [Politico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-26/us-transport-chief-warns-of-more-shutdown-linked-flight-delays))

2/ **EARLIER: The Pentagon is using a $130 million private donation to help pay troops during the government shutdown**. Trump declined to name the donor, calling him “a patriot,” “a friend of mine,” and “a great gentleman.” The money, however, came from Timothy Mellon, a billionaire heir and major Trump donor. The Pentagon said it accepted the money under its “general gift acceptance authority” and that it would be used “to offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/anonymous-donor-military-pay-shutdown) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/24/military-salaries-donation-trump/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/timothy-mellon-donation-troops.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/pentagon-accepts-anonymous-130-million-donation-help-pay-troops-rcna239694) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-military-payroll-anonymous-donation-trump-e327c306292043755d9d700731039e83))

3/ **The largest federal workers union urged Congress to end the shutdown and pass a “clean continuing resolution” to reopen the government**. Senate Democrats have continued to demand an agreement to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies before voting to reopen, while Republicans want to pass a stopgap funding bill before negotiating ACA subsidies. The House-passed measure to fund the government through Nov. 21 has failed repeatedly in the Senate. The shutdown began Oct. 1 and has entered its fourth week, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/afge-largest-federal-workers-union-end-shutdown-rcna239767) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/union-pressures-democrats-to-end-government-shutdown-6028b2b1) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/27/congress/afges-shutdown-message-00623518) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/27/largest-employees-union-end-shutdown/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/federal-workers-union-call-to-end-shutdown-pressuring-democrats) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/afge-union-government-shutdown-federal-workers) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/federal-union-government-shutdown-end.html))

4/ **Indiana Gov. Mike Braun called a special session to consider redrawing the state’s congressional map to give Republicans up to two additional U.S. House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms**. The move follows direct White House involvement, including two visits by JD Vance to lobby state lawmakers and a phone call from Trump urging Indiana Republicans to support new maps. Support in the state Senate, however, remains uncertain, with a spokesperson saying “the votes still aren’t there.” Republicans have already gained about seven U.S. House seats through new maps in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina, while Democratic efforts in California and Virginia could add up to nine seats if approved. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/indiana-redistricting-special-session-braun-63f3447efcc34529dfc363a96a763b6e) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/27/virginia-trump-redistricting-amendment-session/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/indiana-special-session-redistricting-congressional-maps-f8e3893c) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/indiana-gov-mike-braun-calls-special-session-consider-new-congressiona-rcna240021) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/us/indiana-redistricting-special-session.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/indiana-gov-mike-braun-announces-special-session-include/story?id=126897545) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/indianapolis/2025/10/27/indiana-mike-braun-special-congressional-redistricting-session) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/indiana-congressional-maps-redisctricting-governor))

5/ **EARLIER: Trump ended trade talks with Canada and said he would add an additional 10% tariff after Ontario aired a U.S. ad using Ronald Reagan’s 1987 remarks opposing tariffs**. In that speech, Reagan warned tariffs might appear patriotic, but “hurt every American worker and consumer” and “trigger fierce trade wars.” The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation said the ad “misrepresented” Reagan’s words, prompting Trump to say Canada used a “FAKE” Reagan ad to influence the Supreme Court, which is currently considering a legal challenge to his tariffs, and declared, “ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.” Trump later called the ad a “hostile act” and announced the tariff increase. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign would pause after it aired during the first two World Series games. Carney said Canada “stands ready” to resume talks “when the Americans are ready.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/25/business/trump-tariffs-canada-reagan) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/canada/trump-tariffs-reagan-ad.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/25/trump-to-slap-higher-tariffs-on-canada-00623090) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-canada-tariffs-3cbc1cbf9ed53a10b442fd55dae1e0a3) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-announces-10-increase-tariffs-canada-2025-10-25/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/trump-canada-tariffs-reagan-ad/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-hikes-tariffs-on-canada-by-10-over-ontario-ad-0fc64764) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/trump-says-he-won-t-resume-canada-trade-talks-for-a-while) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-canada-trade-ronald-reagan-rcna239508))

6/ **Trump – again – refused to rule out an unconstitutional third term, saying “I would love to do it”** and telling reporters aboard Air Force One, “Am I not ruling it out? You’ll have to tell me.” The 22nd Amendment, however, prevents anyone from being elected president more than twice. Separately, Trump said he underwent an MRI during his recent Walter Reed visit and called the result “perfect,” adding, “I gave you the full results,” while declining to say why the scan was done. A White House physician’s memo said the exam included “advanced imaging” and described Trump’s health as “exceptional,” but it didn’t mention an MRI or its purpose. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/27/trump-2028-third-term-jd-vance) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/trump-says-he-received-perfect-mri-during-walter-reed-visit) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-mri-checkup-calls-results-perfect/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5574520-trump-mri-cognitive-test/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-health-mri-walter-reed-physical-exam-bruise-swelling-rcna240076) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/donald-trump-mri-health-walter-reed) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/us/politics/trump-mri-third-term.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/25/trump-timothy-mellon-military-donor-government-shutdown.html))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump criticized Putin for testing a nuclear-capable cruise missile instead of ending the war in Ukraine**, saying “you ought to get the war ended” while noting that a U.S. nuclear submarine was “right off Russia’s coast.” Russia claimed the Burevestnik missile could fly more than 8,000 miles, though U.S. experts questioned its capabilities. The Kremlin said Moscow would continue testing weapons, citing “national interests." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/27/russia-us-trump-putin-missile-test/))

2. **Trump said he wants to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, telling reporters to “put out the word.”** He called North Korea “sort of a nuclear power,” suggesting a possible break from U.S. policy that rejects recognizing Pyongyang’s arsenal. Kim has said he would meet only if the U.S. ends its push for denuclearization. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/trump-pitches-meeting-with-kim-jong-un-during-asia-tour-ba0c55ec) / [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09gg8v721o))

3. **The Pentagon ordered an aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America**, expanding Trump’s campaign of strikes on suspected drug boats that have killed at least 43 people. Trump claimed the U.S. was in an “armed conflict” with cartels and vowed, “We’re going to kill them,” though Congress hasn’t authorized military action. Critics and legal experts also question the legality of targeting civilians and warned the buildup could widen conflict in Venezuela and Colombia. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/caribbean-sea-boat-strike-us-venezuela.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cartels-hegseth-drugs-boat-strikes-6c3316b2852723e26c39dc701bba9d52) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/24/ford-trump-military-caribbean-hegseth) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/24/aircraft-carrier-trump-caribbean-latin-america/))

4. **The Trump administration approved new oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge**. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the decisions showed that “Alaska is open for business.” Major oil companies, however, have shown little interest in the new Arctic leases, citing high costs, limited infrastructure, and reputational risks tied to drilling in a protected wilderness. Previous lease sales under Trump’s first term drew almost no bids. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/climate/trump-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-oil-drilling.html))

5. **Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., breaking with decades of U.S. dietary guidelines, plans to urge Americans to eat more saturated fats**. He said the new advice would promote “saturated fats of dairy, of good meat, of fresh meat and vegetables.” Scientists, however, warned the shift would raise cholesterol levels, increase heart disease risk, and bypass the usual scientific review process. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/rfk-jr-saturated-fats))

6. **Trump told Mike Pence “You’ll go down as a wimp” on Jan. 6**, according to Pence’s handwritten notes revealed in a [new book](https://amzn.to/3WqusWM) by journalist Jonathan Karl. The notes detailed Trump’s pressure to block certification of Biden’s victory, which Pence refused. Special counsel Jack Smith’s team had planned to use Pence’s notes and Trump’s phone records to show he pressured Pence to block certification, but prosecutors dropped the case after Trump’s 2024 election because a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity barred criminal charges against a sitting president.
