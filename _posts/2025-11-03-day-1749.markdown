1/ **The Trump administration will restart SNAP payments but only at half the usual amount**, using the program’s $4.65 billion contingency fund after two judges ordered the government to keep the program running during the shutdown. USDA said it will deplete that fund entirely to issue the partial November benefits, leaving no reserve for December or future emergencies if the shutdown continues. The decision leaves roughly 42 million Americans with reduced and delayed payments, as states must reprogram their outdated systems before payments can begin. USDA declined to draw from a separate $23 billion emergency account for child nutrition, saying “Section 32 Child Nutrition Program funds are not a contingency fund for SNAP.” Hours before millions of Americans lost their supplemental food benefits, Trump [hosted](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hosted-great-gatsby-halloween-party-hours-snap/story?id=127091016) a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween [party](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/02/trump-gatsby-1920s-party/87052157007/) at Mar-a-Lago titled “A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/snap-monday-deadline-rcna241386) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/november-snap-benefits-government-trump) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/snap-food-stamps-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/03/trump-administration-snap-benefits/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/trump-admin-will-partially-fund-november-snap-benefits-00633564) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/snap-trump-food-court-shutdown.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/03/trump-administration-snap-benefits-partial-funding) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-use-emergency-funds-pay-partial-food-aid-benefits-2025-11-03/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/snap-government-shutdown-court-order-b354aa0b596dcb8bfc6dc59a3382e811) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-03/trump-administration-says-food-stamps-will-be-partially-funded) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-to-pay-partial-snap-benefits-during-shutdown-ed39be0d) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snap-food-stamps-trump-administration-contingency-fund/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5596121/snap-food-benefits-trump-government-shutdown))

* **EARLIER: Two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to keep paying SNAP benefits during the shutdown using emergency funds**, with Judge Indira Talwani calling the suspension “unlawful” and requiring a plan by Monday (today), and Judge John J. McConnell Jr. directing immediate use of contingency funds. McConnell’s written order said the government must make full payments by today or partial payments by Wednesday. Trump said, “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” while warning that payments would be delayed.

2/ **The government shutdown entered its 34th day and is on track to become the longest in U.S. history as Trump refused to negotiate with Democrats over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies**. Trump said he “won’t be extorted” and claimed that Democrats “have lost their way,” adding that “If they don’t vote, that’s their problem.” Trump, meanwhile, urged Republicans to “end the filibuster” so “we can do exactly what we want.” Senate Republicans, however, rejected the idea, with Majority Leader John Thune calling the 60-vote rule “a safeguard” and Speaker Mike Johnson warning it “would radically change the Senate.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-democrats-senate-filibuster-1f147746aab58daffd8a8cb578df0b81) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/democrats-urge-trump-to-engage-in-talks-as-shutdown-closes-in-on-record-6d31a6ab) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/trump-republicans-kill-filibuster-00631221) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/31/trump-end-filibuster-shutdown-nuclear-option/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/trump-s-call-for-nuclear-option-to-kill-the-filibuster-explained) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5583104-speaker-johnson-warns-of-consequences-of-nuking-filibuster/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/trump-republicans-senate-filibuster-shutdown) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/filibuster-trump-republicans-shutdown-00631300) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trumps-demands-throw-wrench-into-delicate-shutdown-talks-a4507a94) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/congress-longest-shutdown-record-00632927) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-government-shutdown-democrats-fault-60-minutes/))

3/ **CBS News heavily edited Trump’s “60 Minutes” interview – the same standard editorial practice that led him to sue the network last year over its editing of a Kamala Harris segment**. The interview, his first with the show in five years, aired one year after Paramount, CBS’s parent company, paid $16 million to settle that lawsuit. CBS cut Trump’s remarks that “60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” his praise for new editor in chief Bari Weiss — “a great new leader” — and his approval of the Skydance takeover of Paramount, which he called “the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.” Trump told Norah O’Donnell, “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t want to embarrass you.” CBS cut that entire exchange and said the interview was “condensed for clarity” and offered no explanation for the removals. The unedited transcript also showed a tense exchange over Trump’s pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty in 2023 to money-laundering. Trump claimed “I don’t know who he is,” called the prosecution a “Biden witch hunt,” and added, “My sons are involved in crypto much more than me.” Zhao’s company, Binance, had earlier facilitated a $2 billion deal with the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, before receiving the pardon in October. Trump also defended ICE raids as necessary, saying they “haven’t gone far enough,” and suggested he could invoke the Insurrection Act “in a heartbeat” to send troops into U.S. cities. When pressed about agents using tear gas in Chicago and smashing car windows, he said, “Yeah, because you have to get the people out,” blaming “liberal judges that were put in by Biden and Obama” for slowing deportations. Trump also confirmed plans to resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in decades, saying, “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. We’re not going to be the only country that doesn’t test.” Democrats, meanwhile, called for an FCC review of CBS’s edits, citing possible “news distortion” under standards set by Trump’s own FCC. Chair Brendan Carr, however, dismissed the idea as “frivolous.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/03/trump-60-minutes-interview-cbs-key-moments) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/media/trump-cbs-60-minutes-norah-odonnell-ellison-bari-weiss) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/trump-60-minutes-interview-binance-cz-pardon.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/03/trump-60-minutes-interview-recap/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-cbs-60-minutes-interview-edited) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-knows-nothing-crypto-billionaire-cz-binance-pardon-biden-rcna241584) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/trump-60-minutes-binance-cz-pardon.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-60-minutes-interview-highlights/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5585838-trump-defends-ice-raids/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-02/trump-says-immigration-raid-efforts-haven-t-gone-far-enough) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/03/trump-60-minutes-editing-criticism-binance))

4/ **A federal judge permanently blocked Trump’s order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration**, calling it unconstitutional. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that “the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” saying only Congress and the states control election rules. The decision finalizes an earlier injunction and blocks the Election Assistance Commission from enforcing the order. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-ruling-trump-citizenship-proof-vote) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/31/trump-immigration-citizenship-federal-judge) / [Democracy Docket](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/in-big-win-for-voters-and-democrats-court-blocks-trumps-demand-for-voter-id-on-registration-form/) / [Votebeat](https://www.votebeat.org/2025/10/31/judge-blocks-trump-executive-order-proof-of-citizenship/))

5/ **For the third time a federal judge blocked Trump from deploying the National Guard to Portland, saying there was “no credible evidence” protests had grown out of control before his order**. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that violence was “isolated and sporadic” and caused no serious injuries or major damage. The decision followed a three-day trial over whether the administration met the legal threshold for using troops against domestic protests. The Ninth Circuit is set to rehear the case, leaving the Guard federalized, but not deployed. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/portland-oregon-national-guard-ruling) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/oregon-national-guard-deployment-trump-judge-61aa5de05e761af70868842cdcb25609))

6/ **The Justice Department told lawmakers the Trump administration doesn’t need congressional approval to keep striking alleged drug-smuggling boats because the War Powers Resolution doesn’t apply**. A senior administration official said the operations didn’t place U.S. troops in danger and that “the kinetic operations underway do not rise to the level of ‘hostilities.’” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also required Pentagon personnel to get prior approval before talking to Congress about the strikes or other “sensitive military operations.” The military, meanwhile, carried out another strike in the Caribbean that Hegseth said killed three people, bringing the total killed in roughly 15 strikes since early September to at least 64.
