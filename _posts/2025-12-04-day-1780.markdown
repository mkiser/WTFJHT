1/ **The Supreme Court allowed Texas to use its new congressional map for the 2026 elections, blocking a lower court ruling that found the plan was likely a racial gerrymander**. The order granted an emergency request from Gov. Greg Abbott after a three-judge panel said Republican lawmakers, acting at Trump’s urging, diluted the voting power of Black and Latino residents. The justices said Texas was likely to win on appeal and paused the injunction while they review the case. The map was designed to add up to five Republican House seats.

2/ **Federal agents arrested the man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC offices the night before Jan. 6 Capitol attack**. An FBI affidavit said investigators tied Brian Cole Jr. to the devices through purchase records, cellphone data and a license plate reader, though officials didn’t explain why earlier reviews of the same evidence failed to identify him.

3/ **The Government Accountability Office opened an investigation into Bill Pulte after Senate Democrats accused the Federal Housing Finance Agency director of abusing his position to target Trump’s perceived political enemies with criminal referrals**. The probe will examine whether Pulte and FHFA staff misused federal authority and resources in sending mortgage fraud referrals on New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, Rep. Eric Swalwell, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to the Justice Department. A federal judge has already dismissed charges tied to Pulte’s referral of James.

4/ **The Trump administration renamed the U.S. Institute of Peace to the “Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace,”** bolting his name onto its Washington headquarters. The State Department said the rebranding honors “the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history” and will stand as a reminder of “what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability.” The White House, meanwhile, called the Institute of Peace a once "bloated, useless entity," but the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace "is both beautifully and aptly named after a President who ended eight wars in less than a year." The move follows Trump’s February order to shut down the congressionally created institute and a March takeover by the Department of Government Efficiency, which removed the leadership and fire most staff.

5/ **98% of more than 2,100 Foreign Service employees reported lower morale this year**. The American Foreign Service Association said workplace changes since January have made it harder to advance U.S. diplomatic priorities and warned that thousands of departures and ongoing reductions in force have left the State Department struggling to sustain core functions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/us/politics/state-department-morale-survey.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/04/trump-foreign-service-low-morale-survey) / [Federal News Network](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/12/a-workplace-crisis-nearly-all-foreign-service-employees-report-lower-morale-in-union-led-survey/))

poll/ **46% of Americans say the cost of living in the U.S. is worst than than they can ever remember**. 46% also say this is now Trump’s economy and he’s responsible for the high costs. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747))

poll/ **U.S. economic confidence fell to negative 30 in November** – its lowest level since July 2024. 21% of Americans described current economic conditions as good in November, while 40% described conditions as poor. 27% said the economy is getting better, while 68% said the economy is getting worse.
