1/ **During Trump’s first stop on his “affordability” tour in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, he claimed he’s "crushing it" on inflation and delivering “lower prices” and “bigger paychecks.”** Throughout the 90-minute, rally-style event, Trump blamed Democrats for “the high prices,” mocked “affordability” as a new political word, and claimed his tariffs prove “America is winning again,” and that “Pennsylvania is prospering again.” Government figures, however, show inflation running around 3% a year, similar to the end of the Biden administration and above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, while grocery and rent costs are up roughly 30% over the last five years. Nevertheless, Trump pointed to the strong stock market and new factory investments as evidence of his success, even though manufacturing has lost about 30,000 jobs since February and economists have warned that his tariffs could weaken business investment and long-term growth. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/politics/trump-affordability-economy-pennsylvania.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/g-s1-101506/trumps-speech-grievances-about-immigrants) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/trump-affordability-pennsylvania/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-economy-campaign-speech-pennsylvania-rcna248291) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-affordability-speech-economy-pennsylvania/))

* **U.S. farmers say Trump’s new $12 billion aid package falls short of their projected $35 billion to $44 billion in losses on major crops**, calling it “a lifeline, not a long-term solution” and “a Band-Aid on an open wound.” ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-farmers-say-trumps-12-billion-aid-package-wont-cover-losses-2025-12-10/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5642146-soybean-farmers-trump-relief/))

2/ **The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 3.5 to 3.75%, the third reduction this year**. The Fed signaled that it may pause further cuts as officials split over how to handle inflation and a weakening job market. New projections showed most policymakers expect only one cut in 2026 and raised their forecast for economic growth even though they still see inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target for several years. Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is “well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves,” framing the move as protection against labor market risks, while Trump dismissed the decision as a “rather small” cut that “could have been doubled.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/federal-reserve-interest-rates-cut-00684371) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-cuts-rates-again-signals-it-may-be-done-for-now-67069bb5) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/trump-fed-interest-rates-powell.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/fed-cuts-rates-with-three-dissents-projects-one-cut-in-2026) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/divided-fed-set-announce-decision-interest-rates/story?id=128204427) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/fed-interest-rates-decision) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-economy-inflation-jobs-442de589de9b99bb811f76e402b00948) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/10/federal-reserve-rate-cut-stagflation/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/business/economy/fed-meeting-interest-rate-decision.html))

3/ **The House passed a $900 billion defense bill that eliminates Pentagon diversity, equity and inclusion offices, cuts $1.6 billion in climate programs, and writes several of Trump’s executive orders into law**. The bill gives troops a 3.8% pay raise, withholds 25% of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until lawmakers receive unedited videos and command orders for lethal boat strikes near Latin America, and requires the Pentagon to keep at least 76,000 troops in Europe and 28,500 in South Korea, and authorizes $400 million a year in security aid for Ukraine for two years. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/us/politics/house-approves-defense-bill.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/defense-bill-congress-trump-dd67d203accfb65b7604072ebb5da153) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/house-passes-ndaa-boat-strike-videos-00685641))

4/ **The U.S. seized a sanctioned oil tanker loaded with Venezuelan crude off the country’s coast**, which Trump called the “largest one ever seized” even as basic facts about the operation remain unclear. Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the vessel as the Skipper and said Coast Guard, FBI, and Homeland Security teams fast-roped from helicopters to execute a sealed seizure warrant for a ship she linked to “sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran” that supports foreign terrorist organizations. Officials, however, didn’t explain whether the U.S. is claiming the ship, the oil, or both, and have released no public evidence beyond Bondi’s statement and short video clips of the boarding. Venezuela’s government, meanwhile, called the move “barefaced robbery and an act of international piracy,” while U.S. officials described it as part of a broader effort to cut off Nicolás Maduro’s oil revenue after more than 20 deadly strikes on alleged drug boats that legal experts say may violate international law. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/us-seizes-oil-tanker-coast-venezuela-trump-says-rcna248478) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/us/politics/oil-tanker-seized-us-venezuela-trump.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-fighter-jets-gulf-of-venezuela) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/venezuela-oil-tanker-seized-trump) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tanker-seized-venezuela-maduro-0a148ba01684fc6ce1a228dd276732c0) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-seizes-oil-tanker-off-the-coast-of-venezuela) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-venezuela-oil-tanker-seize.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/u-s-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-in-escalation-of-pressure-on-maduro-regime-ec2cd0b6) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/us-seizes-venezuelan-oil-tanker-00685289))

5/ **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to end its deployment of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles and return control of the soldiers to Gov. Gavin Newsom**. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump went too far by keeping about 100 Guard members in the city months after the protests that first prompted the call-up, warning that the administration was asking for a “blank check” to use state troops as a national police force. The order is on hold until Monday to give the administration time to appeal. The White House, meanwhile, insists that Trump used his “lawful authority." ([CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/12/trump-national-guard-los-angeles-ruling/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/nx-s1-5639822/national-guard-la-court-judge-trump) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/us/politics/national-guard-los-angeles-trump.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/us/judge-blocks-la-national-guard-deployment) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/newsom-can-regain-control-of-state-troops-for-now-judge-says) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-blocks-trumps-national-guard-deployment-los-angeles-2025-12-10/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-trump-end-california-national-guard-troop-deployment-los-rcna248418) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-end-national-guard-deployment-in-los-angeles-ed420fce))

6/ **The Department of Homeland Security will buy six Boeing 737 jets to build its own deportation fleet for ICE for roughly $140 million**. DHS claimed the move will save $279 million "by allowing ICE to operate more effectively, including by using more efficient flight patterns" and will help Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem get "criminal illegal aliens OUT of our country." ICE Air Operations currently uses a mix of chartered and commercial planes and, since Trump took office, has run more than 1,700 deportation flights to 77 countries and over 6,300 domestic flights to transfer detainees between U.S. jails as it works toward a goal of 1 million removals. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/homeland-security-boeing-737-ice-deportations.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/12/10/dhs-deport-boeing-contract/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-buys-own-boeing-737-fleet-to-speed-trump-s-deportation-push))

* **Trump’s English-language mandate has taken about 9,500 commercial truck drivers off U.S. roads since June**, even as the industry faces a driver shortage. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy claimed it’s a safety measure so operators can read signs and talk with officers and vowing to keep "dangerous, unqualified truck drivers off the road." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/truck-drivers-license-trump-english-language-requirement) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-10/trump-immigration-rules-remove-thousands-of-truckers-disrupting-us-freight))

7/ **The Trump administration plans to require tourists from 42 countries to disclose five years of social media history before entering the U.S.** as part of the ESTA pre-travel screening system. Under the plan, applicants would also have to submit past email addresses and phone numbers, detailed information about immediate family members, selfies and other biometrics. Customs and Border Protection said the changes are meant to enforce a Trump executive order to block foreigners who may pose security risks. Immigration lawyers and digital rights advocates, however, warned the plan may chill speech and travel, while groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that mandatory social media surveillance invades privacy without clear evidence it improves security. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-to-inspect-tourists-social-media-history-from-past-5-years-.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-wants-to-screen-foreign-visitors-social-media-history-for-entry-91d1a1ef) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/foreign-tourists-five-years-social-media-history-customs-border-protec-rcna248337) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/12/10/esta-social-media-united-states/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/esta-visa-waiver-social-media-travel-foreigners-9a1daaba39ffbb7bf24f0f411c2a0275) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/travel/social-media-tourists-visa-border-patrol.html))

8/ **A third federal judge ordered the release of grand jury transcripts and other investigative records from Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 federal sex trafficking case**, expanding the cache of files the Justice Department must make public under a new law. The ruling follows similar orders from the judges overseeing Ghislaine Maxwell’s case and an earlier Epstein investigation, clearing the way for hundreds of thousands of pages of records to be disclosed. All three judges relied on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month and signed by Trump, which requires the Justice Department to release nearly all unclassified Epstein- and Maxwell-related investigative materials by Dec. 19 and says records can’t be withheld for reasons like “embarrassment” or “political sensitivity.” The judges also ordered the government to redact victims’ names and sensitive information. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/epstein-sex-trafficking-case-records-justice-department-016bbded12959c90d1679e15aa273b60) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-documents-ruling-00684368) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/new-york-judge-orders-release-jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-records-rcna248393) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/politics/new-york-judge-grants-unseal-epstein-records) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury-unsealed.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/judge-says-doj-can-release-epstein-grand-jury-materials) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/10/epstein-files-release-order/))

9/ **Democrats won Miami’s mayoral runoff and flipped a Republican-held Georgia state House seat**. In Miami, Eileen Higgins defeated Trump-backed Emilio González, becoming the city’s first woman mayor and first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. In Georgia, Democrat Eric Gisler claimed a narrow lead of about 200 votes over Republican Mack Guest in the Athens-area 121st District. Democrats have flipped 25 Republican-held legislative seats out of the 118 decided in 2025, meaning they captured 21% of the Republican seats on the ballot. Democrats have gained ground in Virginia, New Jersey, Iowa, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, while Republicans have failed to flip any seats.

### 🙄 Dept. of These Are Not Serious People. 

1. **CMS administrator Mehmet Oz has been using his weekly agency-wide emails to tell more than 6,000 federal employees how many holiday cookies to eat**, urging them to “set your intentions” and avoid “double fisting” snacks. The agency defended the tips as helpful guidance even as Oz’s history of promoting unproven health claims, including his praise of green coffee extract as a “magic” weight-loss cure and his incorrect statements about hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as Covid treatments. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/dr-oz-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services-tells-employees-to-eat-less/))

2. **Trump admitted that he questioned why the U.S. would admit people from “shithole countries” like Haiti, El Salvador, and several African countries in 2018, contradicting years of denials**. Trump then recounted the Oval Office meeting, saying "Why is it we only take people from shithole countries, right? Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden [...] But we always take people from Somalia. Places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/10/trump-shithole-countries-comment-admission/))

3. **The Trump administration threatened new sanctions on the International Criminal Court unless it changes its governing rules to block any future prosecution of Trump** or his senior officials. The warning follows U.S. pressure to stop probes of Israeli leaders and to formally end an investigation of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-threatens-new-icc-sanctions-unless-court-pledges-not-prosecute-trump-2025-12-10/))

4. **The head of the FAA hasn’t divested his stock in the airline he ran before joining the Trump administration**. Bryan Bedford holds between $6 million and $30 million in Republic Airways Holdings Inc. stock.

5. **Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered all U.S. diplomats to use Times New Roman 14-point font for official documents in order "to restore decorum and professionalism."** Rubio called the use of Calibri, a modern sans-serif font, a "wasteful DEIA program" that “degraded” State Department correspondence. Some studies, however, suggest that sans-serif fonts like Calibri are easier to read and improve accessibility for those with certain visual disabilities. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-stages-font-coup-times-new-roman-ousts-calibri-2025-12-09/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/calibri-font-latest-casualty-trump-administrations-war-diversity-inclu-rcna248381) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/politics/rubio-state-department-font.html))
