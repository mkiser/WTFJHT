1/ **Trump used an 18-minute prime time address to the nation largely to blame Biden for his own economic performance**, insisting that  the current inflation and affordability pressures are “not the Republicans’ fault. It’s the Democrats’ fault.” Although Trump claimed that "I am fixing it," he offered few concrete policy steps, and instead promised that economic conditions would improve next year, predicting “the largest tax refund season of all time” and that “We’re poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen.” The speech’s central announcement was a $1,776 “warrior dividend” for about 1.45 million service members, which Trump claimed was tied to his tariffs, but in reality the roughly $2.6 billion payout will come from military housing funds Congress already approved. Nevertheless, Trump said “The checks are already on the way.” After the address, Trump turned to the media in the room and said that White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told him to give the speech, which comes amid slipping approval ratings and voter anxiety over inflation and affordability. Trump then added, “You think that’s easy?” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-address-economy-popularity-midterms-65d3b79a613cfb778432bcc719a313ab) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prime-time-speech-trump-highlight-victories-amid-low-economic-approval-2025-12-17/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/17/trump-speech-economy/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/politics/trump-address-nation-takeaways.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/politics/warrior-dividend-housing-stipend) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/17/nx-s1-5646614/trump-address-the-nation-economy) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-defends-handling-of-economy-announces-military-dividend-cfa8f07a) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/trump-announces-military-warrior-dividend-amid-inflation-woes) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/trump-warrior-dividend-troops-congress-00697375) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/17/watch-trump-white-house-address.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-national-address-white-house-economy-military-pay-rcna249790) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/trump-economy-speech) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/trump-touts-accomplishments-attacks-democrats-amid-persistent-concerns-over-economy-00697143))

2/ **Inflation unexpectedly eased in November to 2.7% from 3% in September, but economists and the Federal Reserve said the shutdown-delayed CPI report was likely distorted** because it missed October’s data and furloughed workers were unable to collect price data for many categories. Nevertheless, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Inflation continues to fall, wages continue to rise, and America is trending towards a historic economic boom.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, said the central bank would view the report with a “skeptical eye,” and economists flagged the unusually soft housing readings that effectively assumed little or no October increase in categories like rent and owners’ equivalent rent. The report was the first CPI data in two months after the 43-day shutdown, and forecasters said they will look to the next release for a cleaner signal on inflation.

3/ **House Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released another batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate**. The new tranche includes photos of “Lolita” passages written on a woman’s body, heavily redacted foreign passports and IDs, and a screenshot of messages discussing sending “girls” for “1000$ per girl.” The images came with no dates, locations, or explanation and the committee said it blacked out faces and identifying details to protect victims. The release came one day before a Dec. 19 deadline for the Justice Department to publish unclassified Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell files. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/epstein-files-photos-congress-ed6b4809565502c0adea7dd4fec68fb3) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-release-dozens-more-new-images-epstein-estate-2025-12-18/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/jeffrey-epstein-lolita-photo-drop) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/congress-photos-release-epstein-files-00697565) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/politics/epstein-estate-photos-released) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/house-democrats-release-batch-epstein-photos/story?id=128519600))

4/ **The Department of Health and Human Services cut seven federal grants worth millions of dollars to the American Academy of Pediatrics after the group sued Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes to federal vaccine policy**, including the rollback of Covid vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, and the overhaul of the government’s vaccine advisory panel. The terminated grants funded programs on sudden infant deaths, adolescent and mental health, birth defects, and early autism identification. HHS said the grants “no longer align with the Department’s mission or priorities,” but didn’t point to specific problems with the programs themselves. The academy represents about 67,000 pediatricians nationwide and said the terminated grants supported work reaching children and families in communities across the country, making the funding loss immediate and nationwide in scope. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/17/aap-hhs-funding-rfk/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/us/politics/american-academy-of-pediatrics-hhs-funding-rfk-jr-vaccines.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/17/american-academy-pediatrics-funding-rfk) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/rfk-jr-slashes-funding-for-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cuts-millions-grants-american-academy-pediatrics-rcna249769))

* **The Trump administration proposed rules that would cut off all Medicare and Medicaid funding to hospitals that provide gender-related medical care to minors**, effectively forcing hospitals nationwide to stop offering the treatments. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed the care doesn’t meet medical standards and told providers, “This is not medicine. It is malpractice.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/18/nx-s1-5647789/transgender-gender-affirming-care-rfk-jr-dr-oz-trump) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/health/trump-gender-affirming-care-funding.html))
* **Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III**, easing some federal limits but leaving cannabis illegal for recreational use under federal law. “It doesn’t legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form,” Trump said. Some Republicans warned that rescheduling “tells our youth that marijuana use is acceptable and safe.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/18/trump-expands-marijuana-cbd-access/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/politics/trump-marijuana-reclassify-order.html))

5/ **The Democratic National Committee won’t publicly release its internal "autopsy" of the 2024 presidential election loss to Trump**, despite months of expectations that the review would be made public. DNC Chair Ken Martin said releasing the report would be “a distraction,” asking "does this help us win?" Martin instead argued the party is “already putting our learnings into motion.” The review, based on hundreds of interviews in all 50 states, flagged failures in spending, voter contact, and digital outreach, as well as poor Democratic responses to voter concerns about immigration, public safety, and the economy.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration approved about $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan**, immediately prompting criticism from Beijing that China "strongly opposes and condemns" the arms sale. The deal includes HIMARS rocket systems, missiles, howitzers, and drones intended to strengthen Taiwan’s “credible defensive capability.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/u-s-approves-11-billion-in-arms-sales-to-taiwan-angering-beijing-e523a54b) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-arms-sales-china-2743b66e3a4e47a895e731568cef9008) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-us-has-initiated-111-billion-arms-sale-procedure-2025-12-18/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/us-approves-11-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-risking-china-anger))

2. **Trump Media & Technology Group agreed to merge with nuclear fusion startup TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal valued at about $6 billion**. The companies said the deal would give TAE up to $200 million in cash and support plans to begin building a utility-scale fusion plant, even as scientists say core problems like plasma containment could take decades to solve.

3. **FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino will resign in January**. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and conservative podcast host with no prior FBI experience, struggled to distance himself from conspiracy claims he promoted before joining the bureau and faced sustained criticism over his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and the Jan. 6 pipe bomb case. Nevertheless, Trump said Bongino “did a great job,” and suggested he wanted to return to podcasting. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/bongino-fbi-trump-patel-3f388cb8ccd9124eff3a7c7aec32c1b3) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/us/politics/dan-bongino-steps-down-fbi.html))

4. **Trump installed new plaques along the White House colonnade that mocked Biden, Obama, and Hillary Clinton, adding personal insults and disputed claims into what the White House called a “Presidential Walk of Fame.”** The plaques labeled Biden “the worst President in American History,” repeated Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was corrupt, accused Obama of spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign, and repeatedly noted that Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Trump in 2016 under both Bill Clinton's and Obama's plaques. The White House said Trump wrote many of the words himself, calling them “eloquently written descriptions of each President and the legacy they left behind.” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hangs-plaques-mocking-biden-obama-white-house/story?id=128492648) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/us/politics/trump-presidential-walk-of-fame-white-house.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-installs-plaques-mocking-former-presidents-barack-obama-jo-rcna249746) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/17/trump-trolls-biden-obama-new-plaques-presidential-walk-fame/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-plaques-presidential-walk-fame-e6b496f68862f4b678bbe608a0efde95))

5. **The Kennedy Center board, handpicked by Trump, voted to rename the performing arts venue to the "Trump-Kennedy Center."** The White House claimed that the board acted because of Trump’s work “saving the building.” The Kennedy Center confirmed the vote, but House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said the board has “no authority” to rename the institution without an act of Congress.
