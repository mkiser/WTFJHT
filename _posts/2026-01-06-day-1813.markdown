1/ **Trump is “discussing a range of options” to acquire Greenland, including that “utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option,”** framing control of the Arctic island as a U.S. national security priority. Trump claimed that the U.S. “needs Greenland” to counter Russian and Chinese activity, while Denmark and Greenland have said the territory isn’t for sale and that Greenlanders will decide their own future. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller questioned Denmark’s legal right to control the territory and refused to rule out military force, saying “nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.” He added: “We live in a world [...] that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told lawmakers in a closed briefing that despite Trump’s rhetoric, his goal is to buy Greenland from Denmark and that threats of an imminent invasion are to pressure Denmark into negotiations.

2/ **Democrats plan to force a Senate vote to reassert Congress’s war powers after Trump renewed claims that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security**. The effort, led by Democratic senators, would use a privileged resolution to require congressional approval before any use of force, framing the move as a check on presidential power after the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans said an attack on Greenland is not seriously being contemplated. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/06/congress/greenland-war-powers-gallego-00712605) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/trump-greenland-resolution-gallego-invading.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-greenland-republican-reaction-0c51fb0c) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/05/2026/congress-starts-to-take-trumps-interest-in-greenland-more-seriously))

3/ **Trump said Venezuela will turn over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S.** Trump said the oil would be sold at market prices and that he would personally control the proceeds, while separately suggesting U.S. taxpayers could reimburse American oil companies for repairing and rebuilding Venezuela’s damaged energy infrastructure. U.S. agencies haven’t confirmed either arrangement, and it remains unclear how the oil transfer, reimbursement plan or broader production push would comply with sanctions law, existing contracts or international norms following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro, who has pleaded not guilty to federal charges. Nevertheless, Trump directed Energy Secretary Chris Wright to execute the transfer immediately using storage ships to deliver the oil to U.S. ports, which described the crude as “high quality” and "sanctioned." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/trump-venezuela-oil.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/venezuela-to-send-us-up-to-50-million-barrels-of-oil-trump-says) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/energy/trump-venezuela-oil-companies-reimburse-rcna252434) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-us-not-war-venezuela-rcna252427))

4/ **On the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Trump warned House Republicans that Democrats would “find a reason to impeach me” if they lose the 2026 midterm elections**. Speaking at a House GOP retreat at the Kennedy Center, he told lawmakers they “got to win the midterms,” framing the vote as protection against a third impeachment after he was impeached twice during his first term and acquitted both times by the Senate. Trump also mused about canceling the elections, saying he would not call to “cancel the election” because “the fake news will say ‘he wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/trump-predicts-impeachment-if-republicans-lose-2026-midterms-rcna252604) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/us/trump-impeachment-election-conspiracies.html) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dictator-trump-floats-idea-of-canceling-midterm-elections/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/trump-warns-he-ll-be-impeached-if-republicans-don-t-win-midterms) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/06/donald-trump-inpeachment-midterms/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/06/trump-impeachment-midterms-republicans-house-2026) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-house-republicans-if-we-dont-win-midterms-i-will-get-impeached-2026-01-06/))

5/ **The White House published an official webpage on the events of Jan. 6, that describes the Capitol attack as a “peaceful protest,” and that Democrats and the Capitol Police – not Trump supporters – were responsible for the violence**. The page calls Jan. 6 defendants “patriots” and “hostages,” praised Trump for issuing sweeping pardons, and claims that the 2020 election was stolen even though election officials and courts have found no evidence of widespread fraud. The page also accuses Democrats of fabricating an “insurrection” narrative, and blames the Capitol Police and Mike Pence for certifying the 2020 election results.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Homeland Security began deploying up to about 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis–St. Paul area as part of the largest immigration enforcement operation of the Trump administration**.  The monthlong surge, which started Sunday, combines immigration arrests with investigations into alleged fraud tied to federally funded programs, though the scope, targets, and results of those investigations remain unspecified. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-federal-agents-crackdown/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-plans-to-send-2-000-personnel-to-minnesota-amid-fraud-scandal-c8931448) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/us/politics/homeland-security-minneapolis-immigration.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-ice-noem-minnesota-somali-db661df6de1131a034da2bda4bb3d817))
 
2. **The Trump administration said it would freeze about $10 billion in federal funding for child care, cash assistance, and social services in five Democratic-led states**. The freeze affects California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, and includes more than $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care and Development Fund, and about $870 million in social services grants. The administration hasn’t provided evidence of widespread fraud outside Minnesota. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/trump-child-care-minnesota) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667019/hhs-child-care-federal-funding) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/us/politics/child-care-funding-cuts-trump.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hhs-freezes-10-billion-child-care-funding-5/story?id=128945422) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-to-freeze-social-service-funds-in-more-democratic-states-bcb35c1d))

3. **The Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s board voted to dissolve the organization after Congress eliminated its federal funding**. CPB leaders said they rejected keeping the nonprofit dormant after losing more than $500 million in annual appropriations, arguing that an unfunded shell could be vulnerable to “political manipulation or misuse.” CPB said it would distribute all remaining funds and close after more than five decades of channeling federal money to PBS and NPR member stations, underwriting national programming, and subsidizing rural and small-market outlets that lacked reliable sources of support. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/corporation-public-broadcasting-officially-shutting-months-gop-funding-rcna252443) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2026/01/05/public-broadcasting-pbs-npr/abfa42ee-ea73-11f0-91a9-9928b22be817_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/public-broadcasting-pbs-npr-b68f441c227ec7e076c038821b4a5931) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/business/media/corporation-for-public-broadcasting.html))

4. **The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that two state abortion bans, including the nation’s first ban on abortion pills, violated the Wyoming Constitution**. The 4–1 decision keeps abortion legal statewide. The justices said the laws conflicted with a 2012 constitutional amendment guaranteeing competent adults the right to make their own health care decisions, rejecting the state’s argument that abortion is not health care. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-wyoming-ruling-legal-a8396f0ed4a3229eed5e9fea575be63e) / [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/wyoming-court-stops-abortion-bans/))

5. **Trump told House Republicans to be “flexible” on a decades-old ban on most federal funding for abortion as a way to secure a health care deal and “own” the issue ahead of the midterm elections**. Trump said easing the restriction could help unlock legislation to address rising insurance and prescription drug costs, including a proposal to send health care dollars directly to consumers rather than insurers. Senate Republican leaders and anti-abortion groups, meanwhile, said the Hyde Amendment remains a red line for them and warned that abandoning it could fracture the party. Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the issue “probably the most challenging part” of the negotiations.
