1/ **An ICE agent fired three shots into a car and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis during a federal immigration operation**. Video shows Good reversing her car and then turning to drive away. The Department of Homeland Security justified the shooting, claiming that Good had “weaponized her vehicle” and tried to intentionally run over officers, and that the agent fired “defensive shots” in response to what DHS and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called an act of “domestic terrorism.” Mayor Jacob Frey called that account “bullshit,” saying video of the shooting contradicts the self-defense claim and instead shows “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” Frey added: "To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis." Gov. Tim Walz, meanwhile, posted on social media, “I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine.” Walz also issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard for a possible deployment. Minneapolis police, meanwhile, said there was “nothing to indicate” Good was the target of any law enforcement investigation, and the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said they are investigating the shooting.

2/ **The Trump administration will control Venezuelan oil sales “indefinitely,”** with Energy Secretary Chris Wright saying the U.S. will “market the crude coming out of Venezuela” and oversee both the flow of oil and the cash it generates. Wright said the oil will be sold by the U.S. government, with proceeds “deposited into accounts controlled by the U.S. government” so Washington can maintain “that leverage and that control of those oil sales.” He said the money can later “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people,” but added that without “large leverage [...] you don’t get change.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the approach as the first of a three-part plan of “stabilization, recovery and transition,” saying the U.S. will take and sell “between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil” and then “control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, told lawmakers the oil quarantine and continued naval presence are meant to provide “leverage” during the stabilization phase. Officials declined to specify how long the arrangement will last or under what legal authority the U.S. would manage the funds.

* **The Trump administration demanded that Venezuela’s interim government kick out and sever economic ties with China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba, and give the U.S. preferential, exclusive partnership in oil production and favor America when selling heavy crude**. U.S. officials and lawmakers said the ultimatum is designed to use an “oil quarantine” and control of Venezuela’s tanker traffic to deny Caracas export revenue until it realigns its oil trade toward the U.S. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-demands-venezuela-kick-china-russia-partner-us/story?id=128963238) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/07/us-trump-venezuela-china-russia-iran-cuba-agents) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/us-tells-venezuela-to-cut-ties-with-china-and-russia-abc-says) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/world/americas/us-venezuela-cuba-russia-china-iran.html))

3/ **U.S. forces boarded and seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weeks-long pursuit**. U.S. officials said the Coast Guard began chasing the ship after trying to stop it near Venezuela under a federal seizure warrant. They described it as a sanctioned “shadow fleet” tanker that had been deemed stateless for flying a false flag and linked to illicit oil shipments tied to Venezuela and Iran. Russia reportedly dispatched a submarine and other naval assets to escort the vessel, now called the Marinera (previously known as the Bella 1). Russia’s Transport Ministry said the boarding breached the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, and said contact with the ship was lost afterward. The U.S., meanwhile, also seized a second Venezuela-linked tanker, the Sophia, in the Caribbean.

4/ **Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Danish officials next week after Trump’s rhetoric about “acquiring Greenland.”** White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and his advisers were discussing “a range of options” and that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option." Rubio added that “every president always retains the option” of military force, but Trump preferred diplomacy. European governments, meanwhile, issued a joint statement that Greenland “belongs to its people” and that Arctic security must be ensured collectively through NATO with full respect for sovereignty and borders. Danish officials warned that a U.S. attack on a NATO country would mean “everything stops,” reiterating that the island is “not for sale” and calling the military talk “appalling.” Trump nevertheless publicly questioned NATO’s willingness to defend the U.S., posting that he doubted the alliance “would be there for us” even as he said the U.S. would still defend NATO allies. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/greenland-rubio-denmark-trump.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/07/rubio-denmark-greenland-meeting-trump-threats) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/trump-airs-doubts-on-nato-usefulness-as-greenland-tensions-rise) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/us-donald-trump-nato-allies-greenland-crisis-deepens/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/trumps-greenland-military-threat-downplayed-on-the-hill.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greenland-denmark-seek-meeting-with-rubio/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-european-union-greenland-denmark-rubio-frederiksen-4d18970667b130d293ccaf4c0d55c300) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-leaders-push-back-trump-openness-military-greenland-rcna252814))

5/ **The Trump administration issued new Dietary Guidelines that urge Americans to cut “highly processed” foods and added sugar while endorsing full-fat dairy and red meat**. The 2025–2030 guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agriculture Department told Americans to eat protein at every meal and target 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, limit added sugar to no more than 10 grams per meal, and avoid sugar-sweetened beverages, and some artificial sweeteners. The guidelines also keep the existing cap of less than 10% of daily calories from saturated fat even as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the government is “ending the war on saturated fats.” The recommendations are expected to impact federal nutrition programs, including school meals, as agencies define a uniform definition for ultra-processed foods.

6/ **Trump said he was “immediately taking steps” to ban large institutional investors from buying additional single-family homes**, framing it as an effort to address housing affordability. Trump said “people live in homes, not corporations” and blamed high inflation under the Biden administration for pushing homeownership out of reach, but he didn’t specify what legal or regulatory mechanism would implement the ban. The White House also didn’t provide details, and it’s not clear whether such a restriction could be imposed without congressional action. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/trump-to-target-institutional-purchases-of-single-family-homes) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/trump-housing-affordability.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5677021-trump-targets-housing-affordability/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/trump-wall-street-housing-affordability-00714178) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-housing-plan-investors-davos-6ec9f96c03d16c0714a6804c5f703db2) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/trump-housing-large-investor-single-family-home-ban-13e06f61) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/01/07/trump-ban-housing-investors/))

7/ **U.S. employers posted fewer job openings in November, with vacancies falling to about 7.1 million**. That was down from roughly 7.4 million in October and marked the lowest level since September 2024. The decline showed that hiring demand weakened across most industries as layoffs also eased. Together, the figures reinforced what the report described as a low-hire, low-fire labor market. The data also suggests that workers who already have jobs continue to enjoy relative security, but for people seeking work, however, opportunities remain limited, with hiring rates near decade lows.
