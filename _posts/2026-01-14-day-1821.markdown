1/ **FBI agents searched the Virginia home of a Washington Post reporter** and seized her phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of unlawfully retaining classified national defense information. The search, conducted at the Pentagon’s request, sought evidence of communications between Hannah Natanson and the contractor, Aurelio Perez-Lugones, even though Natanson and the Post were told they aren’t targets and haven’t been accused of wrongdoing. Court papers charge Perez-Lugones only with retaining classified material and don’t accuse him of leaking or sharing information with Natanson. Attorney General Pam Bondi, however, claims that Natanson was “obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information.” Investigators said documents marked “SECRET,” including one found in a lunchbox, were recovered from Perez-Lugones’s home and car.

2/ **Denmark said it still had a “fundamental disagreement” with the Trump administration over Greenland after talks in Washington**. Prior to the meeting, Trump insisted that “the United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security” and that “anything less than” U.S. control of the territory was “unacceptable.” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen called U.S. proposals that don’t respect Denmark’s territorial integrity or Greenlanders’ right to self-determination “totally unacceptable.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/greenland-and-denmark-readying-for-key-meeting-to-assuage-trump) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/greenland-denmark-trump-white-house-meeting.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/trump-greenland-jd-vance/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/trump-says-greenland-is-vital-for-u-s-s-national-security-ecae028b) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/denmark-greenland-failed-trump-problems-00729246) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/14/world/europe/trump-greenland-rubio-vance-white-house.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/greenland/greenland-denmark-trump-foreign-ministers-meet-rubio-vance-europe-rcna253953) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/denmark-greenland-trump-white-house.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/g-s1-106011/greenland-denmark-trump))

3/ **The Pentagon began evacuating nonessential personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as a precaution while Trump weighs possible military strikes over Iran’s crackdown on protests**. U.S. intelligence assessed that if Trump strikes Iran, Tehran would retaliate against U.S. forces in the region, including the al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that "I’ve been told that on good authority" by unnamed “very important sources” that Iran has “no plan for executions” of anti-regime protesters. "We’ll find out about it. I’m sure if it happens I’ll be very upset.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-evacuates-some-personnel-from-qatar-air-base-as-trump-weighs-iran-strike-662b1e8e) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/iran-protests-trump-01-14-26) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/trump-iran-protest-execution-death-toll-crackdown-us-military-rcna253952) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/14/trump-iran-strikes-evacuate-troops-bases) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/us-iran-troops-withdraw-qatar/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/14/us/politics/us-base-qatar-iran.html))

4/ **The State Department said it will indefinitely pause immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries**. The pause begins Jan. 21, and applies only to immigrant visas for people seeking permanent residency that the administration considers likely to become a “public charge.” It doesn’t apply to nonimmigrant visas, such as those for tourists, students or temporary workers. The U.S. issued more than 600,000 immigrant visas in 2024, and immigration analysts estimate the suspension could block nearly half of all legal immigrants if it remains in effect for a year.

5/ **Trump gave an autoworker who called him a "pedophile protector" the middle finger and twice mouthed “fuck you” while touring a Ford plant in Michigan**. The White House called Trump’s response “appropriate," calling TJ Sabula "a lunatic [who] was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage." Ford suspended Sabula, who said he had “definitely no regrets whatsoever.” A GoFundMe campaign, titled “TJ Sabula is a patriot!!,” has raised nearly $500,000 so far.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **A federal three-judge panel upheld California’s new congressional maps**, dismissing Republican and Trump administration claims that the voter-approved plan was an illegal racial gerrymander. The 2–1 ruling keeps the maps in place for upcoming midterm elections. Republicans are expected to appeal despite the Supreme Court’s recent refusal to block a similar Texas map.

2. **Trump said he will cut off federal funding to so-called "sanctuary cities" and their states starting Feb. 1**, the latest attempt to use federal funding to punish local governments that disagree with his policy positions, like diversity and inclusion practices, and immigration enforcement. Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were blocked by the courts.

3. **The Trump administration abruptly terminated hundreds of federal grants for mental health and addiction services**, offering little detail about which programs were cut or why. More than 2,000 grants totaling nearly $2 billion are affected.
