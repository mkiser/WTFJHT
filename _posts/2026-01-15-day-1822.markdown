1/ **Trump threatened to “institute the INSURRECTION ACT” after an ICE officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during an arrest** – the second shooting by a federal agent in Minneapolis in a week. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the man resisted arrest and "violently" assaulted the officer, a claim that hasn’t been independently verified and is disputed by state and local officials. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged peaceful protests and implored Trump to “turn the temperature down” and “stop this campaign of retribution.” The White House, meanwhile, accused Walz of “encouraging violence against law enforcement,” and claimed the demonstrations were an “insurgency.” Minnesota said any attempt to deploy the military would be challenged in court.

2/ **Trump delayed a decision on U.S. strikes on Iran after senior advisers warned him that even a large-scale attack was unlikely to topple the regime and risked wider regional retaliation**. U.S. allies in the region, including Israel, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, also warned Trump against a strike on Iran. The White House said “all options” remained open even as Iran signaled it wouldn’t proceed with executions of protesters after weeks of nationwide protests Iranian that security forces have violently suppressed. The U.S., meanwhile, directed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group toward the Middle East, and imposed new sanctions on Iranian security and financial officials.

3/ **María Corina Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize for peaceful pro-democracy activism weeks after Trump ordered military raid that captured Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro**. It’s not clear whether Trump accepted it, and the Norwegian Nobel Institute reiterated that the prize cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred. Separately, the Senate blocked a war powers resolution that would’ve required congressional approval for future U.S. military action related to Venezuela. JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie. And, the U.S. Coast Guard said it seized a sixth oil tanker linked to Venezuela’s sanctioned oil trade, boarding the vessel now named Galileo, previously Veronica, in the Caribbean under a U.S. warrant tied to alleged past Iranian oil shipments.

4/ **Several NATO allies began deploying small numbers of troops to Greenland after U.S. talks resulted in a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland’s future**. Denmark said the deployments under Operation Arctic Endurance are limited and exercise-focused. NATO hasn’t formally approved the operation, and participating governments haven’t said whether the presence will be permanent. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen called Wednesday’s meeting with JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio “frank but constructive.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/greenland-nato-troops-denmark-germany-arctic-trump.html) / [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0ydjvxpejo) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/15/european-nations-troops-greenland-trump-europe-live) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/denmark-allies-boost-greenland-military-presence-donald-trump-ramps-up-pressure/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/denmark-us-rift-persists-as-nato-nations-deploy-to-greenland) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/greenland/european-troops-arrive-greenland-trump-throws-curveball-rcna254166))

5/ **Trump announced what he called “The Great Healthcare Plan”** and urged Congress to “pass this framework into law without delay,” but the White House released only a high-level outline with no legislative text, no cost estimates, no eligibility rules, no enforcement mechanisms, and no timeline for implementation. The framework, however, explicitly rejects extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that expired at the end of 2025 and helped keep premiums down for more than 20 million people. Instead, it proposes sending that money “directly” to consumers through health savings–style accounts without saying how much funding would be provided, who would qualify, whether the payments would cover monthly premiums, or whether plans purchased with the money would have to meet ACA standards, such as coverage for preexisting conditions. Nevertheless, much of the "plan" asks Congress to codify or expand policies the administration has already pursued, including voluntary “most favored nation” drug-pricing deals, new price transparency requirements for insurers and providers, and expanded access to over-the-counter drugs, but doesn’t specify which drugs, what penalties would apply for noncompliance, or which agencies would oversee enforcement. When asked whether Trump could guarantee that people would be able to afford their health care under the "The Great Healthcare Plan," press secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: “If this plan is put in place, every single American who has health care in the United States will see lower costs as a result.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/us/politics/trump-health-care-plan.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-health-care-insurance-congress-savings-accounts-b7b4caae9ad14fda4646c42d3858202b) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/15/trump-health-outline-00730933) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/15/trump-healthcare-plan-aca/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-releases-healthcare-framework-aimed-at-lowering-costs-2716844e) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/trump-unveils-healthcare-framework-asks-congress-to-codify-it) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/trump-great-health-care-plan-costs) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-health-care-plan-direct-payments-obamacare-congress-rcna254232) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/affordable-care-act-enrollment-window-subsidies-health-565b4f27c946a5277a6e5c2563449f55))
