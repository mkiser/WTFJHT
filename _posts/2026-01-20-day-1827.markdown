1/ **Global markets fell sharply after Trump threatened 10% tariffs on imports from Denmark and seven other European countries if they refuse to support his effort to acquire Greenland**. Trump said the duties would increase to 25% if a deal isn’t reached by June. European Union officials said they’re preparing retaliatory tariffs exceeding $100 billion and are considering activating the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument, which could restrict U.S. companies’ access to EU markets. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether Trump can even legally impose the proposed tariffs at all as the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act authorizes country-specific tariffs.

2/ **Trump said he was confident the U.S. would acquire Greenland and declined to set any limits on his approach, saying "You’ll find out."** Greenland’s prime minister, meanwhile, warned residents to prepare, saying a military conflict “can’t be ruled out.” Despite Trump’s repeated threats, U.S. officials said the Pentagon hasn’t been instructed to plan an invasion of Greenland.

3/ **Trump, in a text message to the Norwegian prime minister, wrote that losing the Nobel Peace Prize made him feel less obligated to “think purely of Peace.”** Trump’s message to Gahr Støre read: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” His text concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” Norway, however, isn’t responsible for the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. The independent Norwegian Nobel Committee’s five members are.

4/ **Federal prosecutors served grand jury subpoenas to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and at least three other Democratic officials** as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into their response to the Trump administration’s immigration operation in the Twin Cities. The subpoenas demand documents dating back to early 2025 related to “cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities,” but don’t cite a specific criminal statute or allege any particular acts of interference. The Justice Department said the investigation focuses in part on public statements criticizing ICE after an agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, though – again – they didn’t disclosed evidence that Walz, Frey, or others directed agents be blocked or encouraged violence.

5/ **The Justice Department said it discovered evidence suggesting members of DOGE improperly accessed and shared Social Security data with a political advocacy group seeking to overturn election results in certain states**. The filing said DOGE personnel used unapproved third-party services to circulate SSA information internally and that at least some access occurred while a court order restricted DOGE’s use of the data. At the same time, the government said it hasn’t found proof that Social Security data was actually provided to the advocacy group, and it remains unclear what specific information was accessed or shared. SSA, meanwhile, said it referred the employees involved for potential Hatch Act violations.
