1/ **Trump said he would drop planned tariffs on eight European countries, claiming he had “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland and Arctic security**. He said the 10% tariffs scheduled for Feb. 1 were no longer needed after meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. While Trump didn’t release any details of the framework, the compromise reportedly involves Denmark giving the U.S. sovereignty over small areas of Greenland’s territory to build military bases. Trump claims he needs Greenland for his proposed "golden dome," a missile defense system that could cover North America. NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart only confirmed that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the U.S. “will go forward” focused on Arctic security and limiting Russia and China influence. Danish officials, meanwhile, publicly reiterated that sovereignty is a red line.

* EARLIER: **Trump used his Davos speech to demand U.S. control of Greenland**, saying “No nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.” He added: “I don’t have to use force, I don’t want to use force, I won’t use force.” Trump repeatedly mixed up Greenland and Iceland, saying “Iceland” at least four times and calling Greenland a “big beautiful piece of ice.” European officials said Trump’s remarks left them more confused than before, with one EU diplomat saying it “comes down to how much trust you put in that word,” adding that “few would see that speech and rule out anything.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/davos-donald-trump-greenland-speech-leaves-europe-worried-and-confused/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-davos-speech-takeaways.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-tariffs-davos-europe.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/a-piece-of-ice-for-world-protection-trump-demands-europe-cut-deal-on-greenland-cc1014f6) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/21/trump-davos-speech-greenland-canada-denmark-france))
* EARLIER: **EU lawmakers blocked a vote to ratify a U.S.-EU trade deal after Trump threatened Greenland-linked tariffs**. European officials also raised the EU’s anti-coercion instrument, the bloc’s so-called “trade bazooka,” which could include suspending U.S. operating licenses in Europe or target U.S. services with new taxes. The Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said it would sell about $100 million of U.S. Treasuries, citing “poor U.S. government finances.” In response, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Denmark “irrelevant” and said he was “not concerned at all.” Hours later, Trump reversed course on the tariffs. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/21/business/eu-us-trade-deal-indefinitely-frozen) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/eu-freezes-us-trade-deal-approval-over-trump-s-greenland-threats) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/denmark-irrelevant-us-donald-trump-treasury-chief-scott-bessent/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/danish-pension-fund-divest-its-us-treasuries-2026-01-20/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/danish-pension-fund-akademikerpension-to-exit-us-treasuries))

2/ **Trump said “Canada lives because of the United States” after Prime Minister Mark Carney argued at Davos that the U.S.-led “rules-based order” bargain “no longer works” and that “we are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”** Trump said Canada “gets a lot of freebies from us” and “should be grateful,” saying Ottawa is a beneficiary of U.S. protection and of his proposed “Golden Dome” missile-defense plan. Carney, speaking the day before without naming Trump, said great powers are using “tariffs as leverage” and warned that “if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.” ([CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-davos-canada-carney-9.7054340) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-chides-carney-davos-says-canada-should-be-grateful-2026-01-21/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/trump-says-canada-lives-because-of-the-us-after-carney-rebukes-washington) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/21/trump-davos-speech-carney-canada) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/canada/carney-speech-davos-trump.html))

3/ **Congress released a bipartisan funding package to keep most of the federal government open ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline**. The legislation would fund the Pentagon and major domestic agencies, including Homeland Security, while preserving ICE’s roughly $10 billion budget. While the package provides $20 million for ICE body cameras, it stops short of limits on arrests, detention practices, or deportations that Democrats demanded. The House plans to vote later this week with a separate vote on DHS funding. In the Senate, however, passage is uncertain because Republicans need Democratic support to reach the 60 votes required.

4/ **House Democrats said they’ll oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security**. In a closed-door meeting, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other leaders argued the bill doesn’t meaningfully constrain ICE. Republicans, however, are expected to pass the measure without Democratic help. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/21/hakeem-jeffries-dhs-ice-funding-democrats) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/21/congress/house-democrats-dhs-funding-00738894) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democratic-leaders-will-oppose-dhs-funding-bill-party-rages-ice-rcna255220))

5/ **The Department of Homeland Security launched “Operation Catch of the Day” and started arresting immigrants in Maine**. DHS said the operation targeted people with criminal convictions and, according to U.S. officials, focused largely on immigrants from Somalia. Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin blamed Maine Gov. Janet Mills and other Democratic “sanctuary politicians” for prompting the operation. It’s not clear how long the operation would last or how many federal agents were deployed.
