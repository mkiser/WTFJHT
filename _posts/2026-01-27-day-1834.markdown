1/ **Trump said he’ll be “watching over” an “honest investigation” into the killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis before blaming Pretti for carrying a gun he was legally permitted to have**. “You can’t walk in with guns,” Trump said. “You can’t do that.” Minnesota's gun laws permit open carrying a handgun as long as the gun owner has a valid permit, which Minneapolis Police said Pretti had. Even the NRA, a longtime Trump ally, called the Trump administration’s rhetoric that officers could be “legally justified” in shooting an armed citizen “dangerous and wrong,” urging a full investigation instead of “demonizing law-abiding citizens.” Trump added that you’d have to be a “stupid person” not to think what happened to Pretti was “very unfortunate.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/27/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/alex-pretti-trump-investigation-greg-bovino-homan-minnesota.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/gun-rights-groups-blast-trump-over-minnesota-response-00748217) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/live/minneapolis-shooting-immigration-updates-1-27-2026) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/jan/27/gregory-bovino-tim-walz-donald-trump-minnesota-minneapolis-ice-alex-pretti-us-politics-live-news))

* **Since July, the Trump administration has publicly declared 16 Department of Homeland Security shooting incidents justified even before investigations were completed**. In at least four cases, prosecutors dropped charges or judges dismissed them after video or witness evidence contradicted DHS claims that those shot had attacked officers. No ICE, Border Patrol, or Homeland Security Investigations officer has faced criminal charges or disciplinary action.([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/01/27/ice-border-patrol-shootings-immigration-trump/))

2/ **House Democrats threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if Trump doesn’t fire her**. Democrats said Noem spread false or unsupported claims about the shooting, including that Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon and “violently” resisted officers, that they argued are contradicted by bystander video. Republicans Sens. Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski [also called](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/thom-tillis-lisa-murkowski-call-kristi-noem-resign-dhs-secretary-rcna256233) for Noem to resign. A DHS report sent to the House Oversight Committee, meanwhile, [confirmed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-report-2-agents-fired-weapons-alex-pretti/story?id=129614976) that two federal officers fired their guns at Pretti "approximately five seconds" [after](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/live-blog/minneapolis-live-updates-ice-trump-rcna256077) an officer yelled “He’s got a gun!” multiple times. The ultimatum came after Trump reportedly met for nearly two hours in the Oval Office with Noem and her top aide Corey Lewandowski to discuss the political and operational response in Minnesota. After the meeting, Trump said Noem was “doing a very good job” and rejected calls for her to step down.

* **U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz ordered acting ICE director Todd Lyons to appear in court Friday and warned he could be held in contempt for repeatedly failing to comply with court orders**. Schiltz said ICE had ignored or delayed bond hearings and release orders for detained immigrants, writing that “the court’s patience is at an end.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/ice-director-minnesota-contempt.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-threatens-ice-chief-with-contempt-orders-court-appearance-2026-01-27/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/minnesota-judge-summons-ice-leader-00748831) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/27/ice-federal-judge-contempt/))

3/ **Stephen Miller reportedly directed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to publicly claim that Alex Pretti wanted to “massacre” immigration agents after he was shot and killed in Minneapolis**. The DHS statement was rushed out under Miller’s guidance after reports that Pretti had a gun, despite limited information from the officers involved. Video later contradicted parts of that narrative, and Trump subsequently sent border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. After the statement was released, Miller called Pretti “an assassin” on X, which JD Vance then amplified. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/27/trump-stephen-miller-massacre-minnesota-shooting))

4/ **Trump’s immigration policies coincided with a year-to-year drop in U.S. population growth**, which fell to 0.5% in 2025 from nearly 1% in 2024. The population grew by 1.8 million in 2025, the slowest rate of growth since the Covid-19 pandemic. Net international migration dropped to about 1.3 million from roughly 2.7 million a year earlier, a decline Census researchers said reflects tighter border controls late in Biden’s term and Trump’s immigration crackdown in the first half of his first year back in office. The Census Bureau projects that net immigration could fall to about 321,000 by mid-2026 if current trends continue. Births, meanwhile, barely exceeded deaths.

5/ **U.S. consumer confidence fell in January to its lowest level since 2014 as Americans grew more pessimistic about the economy and the job market**. the Conference Board reporting its index dropped 9.7 points to 84.5 – weaker than during the pandemic and missing all economist estimates. A separate expectations index, which measures consumers’ outlook for business conditions, jobs, and income over the next six months, fell 9.5 points to 65.1 – well below the recession warning threshold of 80. It’s the 12th consecutive month that the reading has come in under 80.
