1/ **FBI agents executed a search warrant at Fulton County’s election facility near Atlanta, seeking records related to the 2020 election**. While FBI only said it was carrying out a “court authorized law enforcement action,” Fulton County said the warrant “sought a number of records related to 2020 elections.” The search comes a week after Trump repeated his false claim at Davos that the 2020 vote was “rigged” and that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.” It also follows the Justice Department’s civil lawsuit against court clerk Ché Alexander seeking the 2020 “physical ballots, stubs and absentee ballot envelopes.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-georgia-elections-office-fulton-county-28e736037521b17197760d2394f0ab43) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-executing-search-warrant-election-office-georgia-related-2020-vote-fox-news-2026-01-28/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/fbi-search-election-center-georgia.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/28/fbi-fulton-2020-election-fraud/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-conducting-court-ordered-activity-georgia-election-site/story?id=129644345) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-shows-fulton-county-election-hub-days-trump-referenced-possible-20-rcna256351) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/fbi-agents-search-election-office-in-georgias-fulton-county-8d4d274d))

2/ **Senate Democrats demanded new restrictions on ICE in any deal to avert a partial U.S. government shutdown**. Democrats tied funding the Department of Homeland Security to legislation requiring warrants before agents enter homes, end roving patrols, mandate body cameras and visible identification, ban agents from wearing masks, and establish a uniform code of conduct with independent investigations after use-of-force incidents. Government funding expires Friday, and Republicans and the White House oppose rewriting the Homeland Security funding bill, warning that changes would likely force a shutdown if the package must return to the House. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/28/shutdown-looms-over-ice-funding/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/government-partial-shutdown-ice-funding-homeland-security-35abc94e6579e701f03d9c18ca5a7c44) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/democrats-demand-immigration-crackdown-curbs-to-avert-shutdown) / [New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/senators-seek-last-minute-deal-on-immigration-enforcement-02383de6) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2026/senate-moves-toward-thursday-shutdown-vote))

* **Trump’s domestic National Guard deployments are costing taxpayers about $93 million a month**. The Congressional Budget Office said that if current deployments continue, total costs could reach about $1.1 billion this year. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/trump-s-national-guard-deployments-costing-93-million-a-month) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/28/nx-s1-5690394/national-guard-deployments-cost-cbo))

3/ **The two federal officers who fired guns during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were placed on administrative leave**. The preliminary internal review sent to Congress didn’t describe Pretti as brandishing a gun or trying to attack officers, directly undercutting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s initial claim that Pretti was “brandishing” a gun and Stephen Miller’s portrayal of him as a “domestic terrorist” and “assassin.” After the review, Miller shifted blame to Customs and Border Protection, saying DHS’s initial public narrative came from CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene” and that the White House was evaluating why CBP personnel “may not have been following” guidance to use extra forces for “force protection” and to create a “physical barrier” between arrest teams and “disruptors.” He also pointed to the operation’s leadership, placing blame on then-border patrol commander Gregory Bovino. Trump then suggested agents could use “more relaxed” and “de-escalated” tactics in Minnesota while the operation continued under border czar Tom Homan. The Justice Department, meanwhile, charged 16 Minneapolis protesters with assault and interference tied to the enforcement surge, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

4/ **Rep. Ilhan Omar was attacked at a Minneapolis town hall when a man approached the lectern and used a syringe to spray her with an unknown liquid**. She appeared unharmed and continued speaking after the man was tackled by security. Minneapolis police said 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak was arrested and booked into Hennepin County Jail on suspicion of third-degree assault, and the FBI later took over the investigation. Trump, meanwhile, attacked Omar – a sitting member of Congress – suggesting without evidence that she “probably had herself sprayed.” Lawmakers from both parties condemned the assault. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/27/ilhan-omar-attack-town-hall-minneapolis/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/man-charges-rep-ilhan-omar-town-hall/story?id=129618409) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/politics/response-donald-trump-ilhan-omar-attack) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/28/trump-minnesota-immigration-omar-walz-attacks) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/ilhan-omar-attack-condemned) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/g-s1-107625/ilhan-omar-sprayed-town-hall) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ilhan-omar-town-hall-minnesota.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ilhan-omar-town-hall-sprayed-7f6ad0b9ece2ae8804b2efe5badd2991) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/man-lunges-ilhan-omar-town-hall-try-spray-unknown-substance-rcna256247) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/rep-ilhan-omar-sprayed-with-unknown-substance-at-town-hall-in-minneapolis-d9cbd133))

5/ **The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at 3.5% to 3.75%, defying pressure from Trump and pausing after three consecutive quarter-point cuts**. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the economy is expanding at a “solid pace,” while “job gains have remained low,” the unemployment rate has shown “some signs of stabilization,” and inflation remains “somewhat elevated.” The decision comes as the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into Powell over his testimony to Congress about cost overruns in a multibillion-dollar headquarters renovation. Powell has called the investigation politically motivated.

6/ **Trump warned that a “massive Armada” led was heading toward Iran and threatened another U.S. attack if Tehran did not “make a deal” on its nuclear program**. He gave no specifics on the terms, beyond demanding “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS” and citing “Operation Midnight Hammer,” which was operation that struck Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump warned that “the next attack will be far worse.” Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations said Iran was “ready for dialogue” but would defend itself “IF PUSHED.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/trump-iran-armada-nuclear-program-deal.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/trump-iran-threats-massive-armada-00751756) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-massive-armada-heading-iran-warns-time-running/story?id=129635685) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-armada-ships-venezuela-violence-rcna256287) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/trump-warns-iran-that-time-is-running-out-as-ships-enter-region) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/28/trump-threat-us-iran-war-armada-nuclear-programme))

poll/ **65% of Trump voters support the U.S. taking military action against at least one foreign country**, with Iran drawing the highest support at about 50%. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/trump-is-threatening-strike-iran-his-supporters-wouldnt-mind-00752821))

poll/ **A record 45% of Americans identified as political independents in 2025**, while Democrats and Republicans each accounted for 27%. Among independents, more leaned Democratic than Republican, giving Democrats a five-point edge in combined party identification and leanings, ending a three-year period in which Republicans held an advantage.

*The 2026 midterms are in 279 days; the 2028 presidential election is in 1,014 days; and it’s been 41 days since the Trump administration was required by law to release the Epstein files.*
