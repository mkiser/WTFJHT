1/ **Trump doubled down on his call to “nationalize” voting, saying the federal government should “get involved” in state elections**. The White House claimed he was referring to the SAVE Act, which would require proof of citizenship to register, however the bill doesn’t federalize elections. It also remains stalled in the Senate after passing the House. And even though the Constitution assigns states to run elections and allows Congress to set the rules, Trump said "I don't know why the federal government doesn't do 'em anyway." He first floated the idea Monday in a podcast interview with ex–FBI deputy director Dan Bongino, urging Republicans to “take over” voting in “at least 15” places. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, meanwhile, said he was “not in favor of federalizing elections,” while Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the idea “outlandishly illegal.” ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5722063-donald-trump-state-elections-nationalization/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-save-act-elections.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-doubles-suggesting-federal-government-involved-state-elections/story?id=129826521) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doubles-down-on-calls-for-republicans-to-nationalize-elections-f0ae3f92) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-colombia-petro-congress-shutdown-ice-immigration-live-updates-rcna256876#rcrd98532) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/trump-election-government-states.html))

* **Steve Bannon said ICE would “surround the polls” during the 2026 midterm elections** following Trump’s push to “nationalize” voting. Democratic secretaries of state, meanwhile, said they’re running tabletop exercises to prepare for potential federal interference and mapping out their litigation, communications, and administrative responses.

2/ **The Supreme Court allowed California to use its voter-approved congressional map for the 2026 midterms**, rejecting an emergency effort by state Republicans and the Trump administration to block it as a racial gerrymander. The unsigned order noted no dissents and left in place a lower-court ruling that the Proposition 50 lines were redrawn on a partisan basis, not a racial one. The move also mirrors the court’s December decision letting Texas use its Republican-drawn map. The ruling keeps lines Democrats say could flip up to five House seats, potentially offsetting up to five new Republican-leaning seats in Texas.

3/ **The Trump administration said it would pull 700 federal immigration officers from Minnesota**, leaving about 2,000 in place as part of the Minneapolis immigration enforcement operation. Border czar Tom Homan said Minnesota county jails were cooperating more with ICE, and he announced a single ICE–CBP chain of command with immediate body-camera deployment for officers in Minneapolis to fix inconsistent use. He added that enforcement would continue at scale, saying mass deportations remain the goal and that people in the country illegally are “not off the table.” Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey, meanwhile, called the move a welcome step, but “not de-escalation.” Homan set no timeline to return to the usual force of roughly 150, saying further drawdowns depend on continued local cooperation and reduced attacks on officers.

4/ **The Justice Department removed a Department of Homeland Security attorney in Minneapolis after she told a judge that “this job sucks” and asked to be held in contempt so she “could get 24 hours of sleep.”** Julie Le had been handling about 90 immigration cases related to Operation Metro Surge, and acknowledged failures to follow court orders, including repeated failures to follow detainee release orders. She told the court that she wasn’t properly trained for the assignment and that “the system sucks.” The judge said workload is no excuse for ignoring orders and demanded an explanation, while weighing contempt for Le and another lawyer. DHS called her conduct “unprofessional” and it’s unclear whether Le has also been fired.

5/ **The man who tried to assassinate Trump at his Florida golf club in 2024 was sentenced to life in prison**. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon imposed life without parole on Ryan Routh after a September jury convicted him on five counts, including attempted assassination and assault on a federal officer. Prosecutors had sought life in prison, citing Routh’s lack of remorse, while the defense had asked for 20 to 27 years. Cannon also added a mandatory seven years for a firearm offense. Before sentencing, Routh began reading a 20-page statement before Cannon cut him off. His attorney said he will appeal.

6/ **The Washington Post laid off about one-third of its staff, calling the elimination of more than 300 newsroom jobs a “strategic reset.”** The cuts ended the sports section in its current form, closed the Books section, suspended the “Post Reports” podcast, shrank foreign bureaus, and restructured Metro. Executives cited a nearly 50% drop in search traffic over three years and losses of about $77 million in 2023, and roughly $100 million in 2024. Publisher Will Lewis has set a break-even goal by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, one of the world’s richest people with about $260 billion, did not comment as critics, including former editor Marty Baron and the Post Guild argued that the paper’s losses were negligible relative to his fortune. They warned the cuts would hollow a “pillar” of American journalism, and noted that subscribers canceled in mass after Bezos blocked a 2024 Kamala Harris endorsement.
