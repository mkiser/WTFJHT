1/ **Democrats accused Attorney General Pam Bondi of turning the Justice Department "into Trump’s instrument of revenge."** Rep. Jamie Raskin, citing Justice Department investigations into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and six members of Congress, said: “Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza. And you deliver every time.” In her opening statement before the House Judiciary Committee, Bondi defended her leadership, praised Trump as “the greatest president in American history,” blamed the Biden administration for politicization, and attacked “liberal activist judges,” claiming the country had “never seen” such “coordinated judicial opposition.” Lawmakers also pressed Bondi over the release of the Epstein files, which exposed some survivors’ names and other identifying details that should have been redacted. They accused the DOJ of redacting prominent names through heavy redactions, including a “potential co-conspirators” list. Bondi, however, blamed the errors on a compressed, mandatory deadline, but refused to apologize directly to survivors seated behind her. Raskin said she was “siding with the perpetrators” and called it “a massive Epstein cover-up” at DOJ.

2/ **A federal grand jury refused to indict six Democratic lawmakers over a video that reminded active-duty military and intelligence personnel they must refuse unlawful orders**. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office sought the indictment after Trump called the video “seditious behavior” and demanded prosecution. The November video featured Sens. Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin and four House Democrats saying, “You can refuse illegal orders.” Prosecutors in Pirro’s office argued that the post violated a law barring interference with military loyalty, morale, or discipline. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/doj-fails-secure-indictment-democrats-involved-illegal-orders-video-rcna258385) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/trump-democrats-illegal-orders-pirro.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/02/10/dc-grand-jury-kelly-slotkin-pirro/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/grand-jury-declines-to-indict-democrats-who-told-servicemembers-to-disobey-illegal-orders-978a6f6f) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/rep-jason-crow-asks-pirro-to-preserve-evidence-related-to-failed-indictment-00776376))

3/ **The House voted to rescind the national emergency Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada, with six Republicans joining nearly all Democrats in approving the resolution**. The measure, which passed 219-211, would terminate the emergency declaration behind the 25% duties. It now heads to the Senate, Trump has threatened to veto it and Republicans lack the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. Trump, meanwhile, warned that any Republican who votes against the tariffs would “seriously suffer the consequences” in primaries. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/us-house-defies-trump-and-votes-to-end-his-canada-tariffs) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/politics/trump-canada-tariffs.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/house-rebukes-trumps-canada-tariffs-00776898) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/11/politics/house-republicans-trump-canada-tariff-vote) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/canada-tarriffs-trump-house-vote-overturn) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/gop-led-house-rejects-trumps-tariffs-on-canada-f03c12d8))

4/ **U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs in January and unemployment fell to 4.3%**. While the Labor Department report beat forecasts, it came with revisions showing the economy added 181,000 total jobs in 2025 – about 898,000 lower than previously reported for the year through March 2025. Job gains in January were concentrated in health care and social assistance, with smaller increases in construction and professional services. Federal government employment also continued to fall. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in January and were up 3.7% from a year earlier. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/us-payrolls-rise-130-000-unemployment-rate-unexpectedly-falls) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/11/economy/us-jobs-report-january-final) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/jobs-january-unemployment-trump) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/january-jobs-report-unemployment-b703b0e3) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/11/business/jobs-report-economy) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/jobs-report-january-2026-.html))

5/ **The Congressional Budget Office projected a $1.85 trillion deficit this fiscal year, rising past $3 trillion by 2036**. The CBO said Trump’s 2025 tax-and-spending law would add about $4.7 trillion to deficits over the next decade, while immigration limits add $500 billion because lower population growth reduces tax receipts. Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, are projected to cut deficits by about $3 trillion, but the CBO noted that that assumption depends on those trade policies staying in place. By 2036, interest is expected to consume 26% of federal revenue – up from 19% this year. CBO Director Phillip Swagel called the current fiscal path “not sustainable.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cbo-budget-outlook-deficits-inflation-debt-45a61cb88eb6083a6e18389d19320c8a) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/us-debt-forecast-to-hit-64t-in-a-decade-as-trump-policies-widen-deficit-00775726) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/cbo-boosts-us-deficit-call-by-1-4-trillion-on-trump-policies) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/business/federal-debt-record-levels-budget-office.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/u-s-budget-hole-set-to-deepen-by-trillions-b5dfe11b))

poll/ **60% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of border security and immigration**, with 49% strongly disapproving. Trump’s overall approval rating stands at 39% – about even with his approval rating (40%) on immigration and border security.
