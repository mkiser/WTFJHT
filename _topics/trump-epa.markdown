<p class="lead">On February 17th, the Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt as the head of the EPA. In his former role as the Oklahoma Attorney General, Pruitt sued the EPA on a baker’s dozen occasions. He's stated that he believes that greenhouse gasses and humans role in the Earth’s changing climate remain “unclear.” Under Pruitt, the EPA has cut budgets, been reticence on enforcing environmental laws, and the EPA’s Office of Science and Technology removed the word “science” from its mission statement.
</p>


<strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The Keystone XL pipeline was approved.</li>
	<li>Although not Pruitt’s decision, he recommended that the US pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which Trump did.</li>
	<li>The EPA announced the repeal of the Clean Air Act, which was devised to shut down polluting coal-fired power plants, and freeze construction of new coal plants while replacing them with wind and solar farms.</li>
	<li>The EPA removed climate change resources from its website that local governments used to address climate change, curb emissions, and devise strategies for adapting to weather extremes. An EPA spokesman said the resources are available by searching through the agency’s archive.</li>
	<li>Pruitt’s security detail added a dozen more agents as the number of threats against the EPA head has increased “four to five times.” Pruitt also purchased a secure soundproof communications booth for his office at a cost of nearly $25,000, even though similar rooms already exist at the EPA.</li>
	<li>The EPA blocked three agency scientists from discussing climate change at a conference. The scientists contributed substantial material to a 400-page report about how climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish in and around the Narragansett Bay estuary.</li>

<p><strong>The EPA issued new guidelines that claim higher radiation levels "usually" pose "no harmful health effects."</strong> The change is part of the EPA's "guidance" on messaging and communications in the event of a nuclear power plant meltdown or dirty bomb attack, and sets a level of acceptable radiation ten times the drinking water standard for radiation recommended under Obama. A 2007 version of the same document said that no level of radiation is safe and concluded that "the current body of scientific knowledge tells us this."

<p><strong>The White House is preparing to dismantle Obama’s <a href="/trump-epa/">climate change</a> policy</strong>. Trump will order Scott Pruitt, EPA chief, to withdraw and rewrite a set of Obama-era regulations known as the Clean Power Plan, which was devised to shut down hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of new coal plants, while replacing them with vast wind and solar farms.

<p><strong>Trump's budget slashes funds for the EPA and State Department</strong>. The budget would funnel an additional $54 billion into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement, and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month.

If those regulations remain intact, automakers will still be compelled to produce more fuel efficient cars regardless of any changes at the federal level.

<p><strong>Senate confirms climate-change skeptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA, an agency he sued as Oklahoma attorney general</strong>. Pruitt’s confirmation marked a serious defeat for environmental advocacy groups. Pruitt has sued the EPA more than a dozen times during the Obama administration, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants and the quality of wetlands and other waters. In Oklahoma, he dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his Democratic predecessor and established a “federalism unit” to combat what he called “unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach” by Washington. Pruitt cleared the Senate by a vote of 52-46.
