<p><strong>Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to approve a short-term spending bill to fund the government through February 8th.</strong> The bill will also reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and roll back several health care taxes. Democrats received assurances from Mitch McConnell that the Senate will vote on a bipartisan DACA bill in the coming weeks in exchange for reopening the government. The Senate voted 81-18 to move forward on a bill to fund the government, which the House passed, sending the bill to Trump to sign.

<p><strong>Senate Democrats have the votes needed to block the stop-gap spending bill that the House is taking up, raising the likelihood the government will close</strong>. At least nine members of the Senate Democratic Caucus said they will oppose the latest short-term spending bill, which would keep the government open through February 16th, extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, but also roll back several <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a> taxes. It doesn't, however, include a deal on DACA, which Democrats have demanded in exchange for their votes. Paul Ryan believes that he has the votes needed in the House to pass the short-term funding measure on Thursday night.

<p><strong>In the event of a shutdown, Mitch McConnell plans to keep the Senate in session and stage a series of votes</strong>. They're intended to place blame for the shutdown on 10 Democratic senators, who are up for reelection this fall in states won by Donald Trump in 2016. McConnell called the Senate Democrats' plan "irresponsible" for being "willing to shut down the government and the Children's Health Insurance Program because they have yet to conclude a deal on DACA."

<p><strong>The House passed tax reform today, but will have to vote again tomorrow</strong> after the Senate parliamentarian said three provisions violated the Byrd Rule and would have to be removed from the bill. Senate Republicans plan to vote on the measure tonight with the provisions removed, which would require the House to revote on the measure tomorrow, since both chambers must pass identical bills. The House initially passed the bill in a 227-203 vote with all but 12 Republicans voting for the bill. No Democrats supported it. Trump is expected to sign the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act into law before the end of the week. The bill will add $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade as it cuts tax rates for corporations, provides new breaks for private businesses, and reorganizes the individual tax code. The legislation also repeals the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>'s individual mandate that most Americans buy health insurance coverage or face a fine.

<p><strong>Susan Collins could change her vote on the final version of the GOP tax reform bill</strong> if the Senate doesn't pass a pair of bills to stabilize the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>'s health insurance markets and resuming cost-sharing subsidy payments to insurers, which Trump stopped in October. Mitch McConnell made Collins an "ironclad commitment" in exchange for her initial vote. House Republicans, however, have signaled that they don't intend to take up health care before the end of the year. Additionally, Collins added two amendments to the Senate bill that would allow taxpayers to deduct property taxes and lower the threshold for tax deductions for medical expenses, which House Republicans had previously voted to eliminate entirely.

<p><strong>The Senate GOP tax plan would hurt the poor more than originally thought</strong>, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. If the tax bill becomes law, 4 million Americans are projected to lose health insurance by 2019 and 13 million by 2027. The bill would add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, and Republicans are aiming to have the full Senate vote on the plan as early as this week.

<p><strong>Senate Republicans added a provision to their tax bill that would repeal the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>'s individual mandate</strong>. In order to be protected from a Democratic filibuster, the tax bill can't add more than $1.5 trillion to federal deficit over a decade. The CBO said that repealing the mandate would free up more than $300 billion in funding over the next decade while also causing 13 million fewer people to have health insurance. Mitch McConnell said Republicans are "optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful."

The subsidies are used to pay out-of-pocket costs for low-income people and represent an estimated $7 billion this year.

Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi responded, saying Trump had “apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system.”  Nearly 6 million enrollees qualify for the cost-sharing payments this year.

They would use budget reconciliation, which would allow them pass legislation with just 50 votes. Republicans have two options: attempt to pass both health care and tax reform for the 2018 fiscal year budget, or take up a budget for the 2019 fiscal year early next year and address an Obamacare repeal in that budget. Doing so would put health care back in the spotlight during the 2018 midterm elections.

<p><strong>Trump's hardball tactics backfired as the Senate rejected its slimmed-down Obamacare repeal with Collins, Murkowski, McCain all voting no</strong>. The bill would have left 16 million more people uninsured by 2026 than Obamacare. Earlier in the week, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against the motion to proceed, causing Trump to attack Murkowski on Twitter, saying she "really let the Republicans, and our country, down." Then, before yesterday's vote, Trump had Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke call Murkowski and Alaska's other Republican senator, threatening that the administration may change its position on issues that affect the state in order to punish Murkowski. She didn't budge. Shortly after the vote failed 49-to-51, Trump took to Twitter: "3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"

The deadline for sending out the monthly <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a> subsidies to health plans is Thursday. Trump has the discretion to decide unilaterally whether the payments continue while a lawsuit House Republicans won in 2014 is being appealed.

<p><strong>Senate Republicans released their new Obamacare repeal bill</strong>. The new bill would maintain some Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, provide new financial support to help low-income people purchase health insurance, allow people to pay for insurance with pre-tax money, and spend  $45 billion to fight opioid addiction. The plan also includes an amendment from Ted Cruz to win over conservatives aimed at building enough GOP support to open debate on the bill next week, but it's not clear if the votes will be there. The  Cruz amendment would allow insurers offering Obamacare plans to also offer cheap, deregulated policies meant to appeal to conservatives. The change could drive away moderates who are concerned the amendment would cause premiums to spike for those with pre-existing conditions. The revised bill would provide an additional $70 billion in funds that states could use to make health care more affordable on top of the more than $100 billion already included.

<p><strong>Mitch McConnell wants to send a revised version of the health care bill to the CBO by Friday</strong>, in an effort to hold a vote before the August recess. Trump teased that “a big surprise” could be coming in the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, suggesting that Senate Republicans are “going to get at least very close” to passing their health care bill. It's unclear if Trump even knows what's in the Senate bill. When asked by reporters if Trump understood the details, McConnell ignored the question and smiled.

<p><strong>An estimated 208,500 additional deaths could occur by 2026 under the Senate health plan</strong>, based on the study of the effects of health care reform in Massachusetts on mortality. The authors found that for every 830 individuals insured, one life was saved. 14 million Americans could lose their health insurance in 2018 and 22 million by 2026, the CBO projects.

His budget did not propose new healthcare spending.

<p><strong>The White House plans to ask a federal court for another 90-day delay in a lawsuit over Obamacare insurance subsidies</strong>, leaving the future of the health care marketplaces in limbo through late August. The suit centers on Obamacare's cost-sharing program, which reimburses health insurers to help low-income people make co-payments at the doctor or hospital. House Republicans say the program was never legally funded in Obamacare and Trump has argued that the markets are fatally flawed and will collapse no matter what his administration does.

<p><strong>Several Senate Republicans said they will set aside the House health-care bill and write their own version instead</strong>. Without changes, the House bill arrives in the Senate well short of the 50 votes it needs to pass (including a tie-breaking vote by Mike Pence). Republicans have hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, which means they can only afford to lose two votes. The bill is expected to undergo major changes that might leave it unrecognizable, including stripping away the provisions that earned the support of hard-right House members to secure its passage. Senate Republicans have opted to use a maneuver known as reconciliation to try to pass the bill with a simple majority, instead of having to clear the 60-vote threshold that is required for most legislation.

<p><strong>Trump urges insurers to work together to "save Americans from Obamacare.”</strong> Trump met with major health insurers in the midst of political divisions over how to dismantle and replace Obama's signature health-care law and intensifying public pressure to preserve the policy. He criticized the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a> for creating minimal health coverage requirements that restricted the types of plans insurers could sell.

<p><strong>GOP’s new plan to repeal Obamacare: Dare fellow Republicans to block the effort</strong>. Republican leaders are betting that the only way for Congress to repeal the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a> is to set a bill in motion and gamble that wavering rank-and-file Republicans don't have the guts to block it. Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about forging ahead with a repeal plan that could leave millions with no coverage — especially after enduring raucous town hall events during last week’s recess.

<p><strong>Republican lawmakers expect that their Obamacare replacement will result in fewer Americans covered by health insurance</strong>. The new plan would do away with the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/trump-health-care/">Affordable Care Act</a>’s requirement that all Americans have health coverage or pay a fine, and replace it with rules that let people choose not to buy insurance, instead paying higher premiums or penalties if they need it later.

<p><strong>Leaked GOP Obamacare replacement would dismantle Obamacare subsidies and scrap its Medicaid expansion</strong>. The legislation would take down the foundation of Obamacare, including the unpopular individual mandate, subsidies based on people’s income, and all of the law’s taxes. It would significantly roll back Medicaid spending and give states money to create high-risk pools for some people with pre-existing conditions. Some elements would be effective right away; others not until 2020.

<p><strong>Republican health proposal would redirect money from poor to rich</strong>. The Republican plan would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work the same flat credit by age, regardless of income. The draft proposal largely contains provisions that could be passed through a special budget process that requires only 50 Senate votes, and fulfills President Trump’s promise that the repeal and replacement of the law would take place “simultaneously.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/upshot/republican-health-proposal-would-redirect-money-from-poor-to-rich.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>)</p>

But throughout his business career, Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand.
