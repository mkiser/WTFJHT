<p class="lead">During the campaign, Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US." His attempts at making good on this promise have been stymied by the Judicial system. His administration has issued three different travel bans to date.</p> 

<strong>Executive Summary:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Seven days after inauguration Travel Ban 1.0 was issued, which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries. The administration gave no notice about the ban, which led to confusion and mass protests at airports across the country. Multiple federal judges blocked the order, even after the administration tweaked it.</li>
	<li>On March 6th, the Trump administration unveiled Travel Ban 2.0, which banned travel from six countries for a 90-day period, exempted permanent residents and visa holders, but kept a 120-day ban on a Syrian refugees. Once again, multiple federal judges blocked the order. The administration, however, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which allowed parts of the ban to go into effect until the hearing.</li>
	<li>On September 24th, Travel Ban 3.0 was released: some countries removed, some were added, but the ban continued to focus on the Muslim-majority countries with the addition of Chad, a US ally. A judge in Hawaii blocked the ban just before it took effect.</li>

<p><strong>The Supreme Court will decide the legality of Trump's latest travel ban</strong>, which targets people from six Muslim-majority countries. The court will hear arguments in April and issue a ruling by the end of June on whether the policy to block entry into the United States by most people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen violates federal immigration law or the U.S. Constitution.

<p><strong>The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the latest version of Trump's travel ban violates federal law, but will remain in effect anyway</strong>. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued an order saying the ban can be enforced while challenges to the policy move through the legal system.

<p><strong>The US Supreme Court allowed the latest version of Trump's travel ban to take effect while legal challenges go forward</strong>. Trump will now be able to prevent people from six mostly Muslim countries from entering the US. It's the first time the Supreme Court has let Trump's travel ban take full effect.

<p><strong>The Trump administration will allow refugees admission from all countries</strong>, but with new rules  to better vet applicants. Refugee admissions had been <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/09/12/day-236/#2-a-supreme-court-justice-temporaril">halted</a> in June for 120 days as part of Trump's travel ban.

<p><strong>A second federal judge blocked Trump's latest travel ban attempt</strong> citing Trump's tweets as evidence the policy carries the same intent as his Muslim ban proposal. The Maryland judge granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the latest iteration of the travel ban, following a <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/10/17/day-271/#10-a-federal-judge-in-hawaii-has-blo">similar order</a> by a federal judge in Hawaii.

<p><strong>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked Trump's third attempt to implement his travel ban</strong>, which was set to go into effect Wednesday. The order was found to discriminate on the basis of nationality. Judges said the two earlier attempts were motivated by bias against Muslims.

<p><strong>The Supreme Court dismissed one of the challenges to Trump’s now-expired travel ban</strong>. The justices were not ruling on the merits of the issue, but said that because the executive order “expired by its own terms” on September 24th, "the appeal no longer presents a 'live case or controversy.'"

<p><strong>Trump issued an executive order to expand his travel ban and permanently restrict visitors from eight countries</strong>. With his revised, temporary travel ban now expired, the new order will stay in place until Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela meet security requirements set by Homeland Security. Starting October 18th, the new order indefinitely bans almost all travel to the US from the eight countries.

<p><strong>Trump's travel ban is set to expire on Sunday, and he is expected to broaden the order</strong>. Early reports suggest a new order may include additional countries and not specify an end date. On September 15, Trump tweeted the ban ought to be "far larger, tougher and more specific."

Said Theresa May: "I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation." The train bomb injured 22 people.

<p><strong>A Supreme Court justice temporarily reinstated Trump's refugee ban</strong>. Last week, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the government couldn't prohibit refugees from entering the country if they had reassurances from a resettlement agency. Justice Kennedy overruled the lower court. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the travel ban on October 10.

<p><strong>Reince Priebus resigned</strong>. The move comes after a week in which Priebus endured a non-stop attack by incoming White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. John Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general currently serving as secretary of homeland security who oversaw the implementation of Trump’s travel ban, will take over as the new White House chief of staff. Trump's advisers pushed back on the Kelly appointment, saying Trump needs someone more in tune with the nationalist political agenda that helped propel him to the White House. Trump announced the news, naturally, on Twitter, saying Priebus was a "good man" but called Kelly a "star." Priebus is the last of the RNC staffers to exit the West Wing. Months ago, Priebus' deputy, Katie Walsh left after being accused of leaking documents, followed by Sean Spicer.

<p><strong>The Supreme Court allows the "grandparent" exemption to Trump's travel ban</strong>. The court upheld parts of a lower court order that temporarily exempts grandparents and other relatives from the travel ban. Now grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and cousins are considered "close family."

The decision means that "grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins of persons in the United States" will now count as close family relationships and can gain entry into the country.

<p><strong>Jeff Sessions said the Trump administration will appeal the latest travel ban ruling to the Supreme Court</strong>.

<p><strong>Trump's travel ban takes effect at 8PM ET today</strong>. Visa applicants from the six countries — and all refugees — will be required to show close family or business ties to the US. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be "close relations."

<p><strong>The Supreme Court partly reinstated Trump's travel ban</strong>. The administration may now impose a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US, as long as they lack a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” Trump said the court’s decision to hear arguments on the travel ban cases in October was a “clear victory” for national security and will go into effect in 72-hours. Three justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — said they would have let the complete ban take effect while the court considers the case.

<p><strong>Trump revised his travel ban to address arguments that it would expire today</strong>. Under the ban's original wording, it would last "for 90 days from the effective date of this order." A separate provision set the effective date as March 16, meaning the ban would have expired June 14. The administration is arguing that the court orders blocking the ban had implicitly delayed the effective date.

<p><strong>The 9th Circuit court ruled against Trump's revised travel ban</strong>. It's the second federal appeals court to uphold the block on the travel ban, declaring that Trump exceeded his authority in suspending the issuance of visas to residents of six Muslim majority countries. “A reasonable, objective observer — enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance — would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion,” Judge Watson wrote.

<p><strong>Trump doubled down on his original travel ban, attacking the Justice Department for the "watered down" version now headed to the Supreme Court</strong>. Trump’s latest tweets undercut his own staff, who've insisted the order is not a travel ban. The administration rewrote his original order, which was thrown out by the courts, in an effort to pass legal muster. The second version was also rejected, but the administration appealed has since appealed it to the Supreme Court. Trump's called for the end to political correctness, saying terrorism "will only get worse" if the US doesn’t "get smart" and reinstate his travel ban. Legal analysts said Trump is undermining his own case.

Before London police had linked the attack to terrorism, or released any information on the identities, ethnicities or nationalities of the suspects, Trump retweeted an unsourced blurb from Drudge – "Fears of new terror attack after van 'mows down 20 people' on London Bridge" – and then started promoting his travel ban.

<p><strong>Trump's call for a Muslim ban was deleted from his campaign site</strong> shortly after Sean Spicer was pressed on why the plan was still there by a reporter. The site had a press release from then-candidate Trump's call for the "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the US until the government could "figure out what is going on." A US district court judge in March said he found "the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban." The Trump administration has argued that the order is not a Muslim ban, but rather a travel ban.

The White House announced the Justice Department would file an emergency motion to stop the halt, but it had yet to do so as of Saturday afternoon. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.

<p><strong>U.S. segregating Muslims as part of travel ban</strong>. Lawsuits being filed contend that the Department of Homeland Security is subjecting refugees, immigrants and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries to flagrant religious and racial discrimination. They also claim that customs officials refuse to provide information in a timely fashion on the numbers and identities of detainees being held, and are aggressively blocking detainees’ access to legal advice.

<p><strong>Under fire, Trump weighs new changes to refugee ban.</strong> The Department of Homeland Security may issue "implementation guidance" that would allow for softening, and even policy changes, to the travel restrictions on migrants. The White House insists that any further guidance wouldn't constitute a walk-back.

<p><strong>Despite growing dissent, Trump gives no sign of backing down from travel ban</strong> even as lawmakers from both parties spoke out against the action and federal judges ruled against parts of it. Judicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement President Trump’s action.

<p><strong>A federal judge issued a stay against Donald Trump's "Muslim Ban".</strong> The ruling – a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office – protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called "Muslim ban." It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed. (<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/muslim-ban-federal-court">Mother Jones</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban.</strong> Administration officials weren't immediately sure which countries' citizens would be barred from entering the United States. The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the President himself, according to court filings.
