**Why don't you publish WTF Just Happened Today? in the morning?** It's not called WTF Just Happened Yesterday.

**I don't have any money. How can I help?** The best way to contribute to the success is to share it with your friends and family. It's free and has a big impact. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwhatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com%2F&via=WTFJHT&text=What%20the%20fuck%20just%20happened%20today%3F" target="_blank">Tweet about it</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com" target="_blank">share it on Facebook</a>. The next best way to contribute is to submit copyedits and fact checks using the "Improve this article" link on every blog post.

### *Editorial process*

**How do you decide what's in the daily update?** I try to approach the daily update like a front page editor at a newspaper would: focus on timeliness, impact, prominence, importance, conflict, and unexpectedness. This is further refined by framing WTFJHT's scope of coverage to the curiouser and curiouser news from in and around executive branch politics in particular – not necessarily politics in general. Together, WTFJHT serves as a single, daily summary of the most important events regarding the White House.

**Where do you get your information?** I read broadly, visiting the homepages of (in no particular order) the New York Times, Washington Post, Politico, NPR, CNN, NBC News, CNBC, ABC News, CBS News, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Axios, Daily Beast, Reuters, Associated Press, the Atlantic, the Guardian, and more. I use several tools to surface links frequently shared across the social web. And, finally, I built [Current Status](https://currentstatus.io/) to aggregate recent, highly-cited stories, with an emphasis on original reporting, depth, and accuracy. Together I try to triangulate on the most important stories of the day that meet the moment, will withstand editorial scrutiny, and endure beyond the news cycle.

**Why do you include polls? Don't you know that polls are biased/inaccurate/not to be trusted/unreliable/fake???** Polls are not a crystal ball. They’re just probabilities. They provide directional evidence about the opinions, preferences, and attitudes of a representative group of people at a given point in time. That makes polling nothing more than a point-in-time temperature check on reality. To me, it’s no different than your local weather report. Sometimes it’s accurate, sometimes it’s less so, but it’s still useful information you didn’t have before. Just don’t put too much stock in it. (e.g. Except clear skies with highs in the low-70s. Wind will be light and variable out of the North-Northeast at 5 mph.) If nothing else, polls are useful to gut check and challenge your worldview.

**When you link to multiple articles, how do you choose the order of the links? What is your criteria for doing so?** I try to cite the primary source of reported news whenever possible. After citing the primary sources, I also include secondary sources that either confirm the news or add original reporting. I then “rank” the sources in parentheses based on how much they influenced my summary (e.g. the outlet that broke the news first, then those that expanded or confirmed it). As for why you rarely see conservative-leaning sites cited by WTFJHT: most don’t actually break news. They typically offer commentary or "alternative facts" framing of stories originally reported elsewhere.

**Is this written by an AI?** No. All content is researched, written, and curated by Matt, an irl human working out of his basement in Seattle, WA. I don’t use AI to generate the blurbs. I may, however, use AI tools for tasks like organizing ideas, copy editing, and improving the writing for clarity in ways no different than using grammar and spell checkers. These tools help sharpen my writing, but the ideas, reporting, and approach are my own. Understanding complex political events and making meaningful connections requires a human approach grounded in journalistic ethics, curiosity, and accountability. And lastly, you'll note that the typos are a dead giveaway that a human wrote it.

**Why I use "genocide" rather than "war" to describe what’s happening in Gaza**. I use the word “genocide” because the most authoritative international bodies that have formally investigated events in Gaza have concluded that Israel’s conduct meets the 1948 Genocide Convention standard. To be clear, this isn’t a personal opinion. Instead, it reflects my deference to the official findings reached by several independent investigations. It’s also worth noting that many who object to the use of “genocide” to describe what’s happened in Gaza typically point to media aligned with Israeli perspectives. While not inherently wrong, I do find that narrowing the debate to partisan media coverage risks trading confirmation bias for evidence, reinforcing preexisting beliefs rather than objectively engaging in the underlying legal and factual record. In an era where “bias” is breathlessly invoked to discredit nearly all reporting, it’s especially important to distinguish between the formal findings from independent investigations, human rights organizations, and legal institutions that operate across ideological lines and the media narratives shaped by politics. That said, the UN-mandated Commission of Inquiry concluded in Sept. 2025 that Israel has committed genocide, identifying four of the five acts listed in the 1948 Genocide Convention and citing statements by Israeli officials as direct evidence of intent. Amnesty International reached the same conclusion after its own investigation, and the International Association of Genocide Scholars passed a resolution stating that Israel’s actions meet the legal definition. Major Israeli human-rights groups, including B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights – Israel, have issued similar findings. While the International Court of Justice hasn’t ruled yet on whether Israel has committed genocide, it has found that the rights Palestinians hold under the Genocide Convention appear both plausibly and seriously at risk of violation. On that basis, the Court issued binding emergency orders requiring Israel to prevent genocidal acts, and later instructed it to immediately stop its offensive in Rafah and to allow life-saving humanitarian aid into the region. Further, the Convention itself makes genocide a crime “whether committed in time of peace or in time of war,” and international law imposes a duty to prevent genocide once serious risk is evident. So to describe what is happening in Gaza – more than 67,000 people killed and 169,000 injured as of Oct. 2025, with roughly 90% of Gaza’s 2.1 million people displaced into conditions of famine and facing life‑threatening circumstances – as merely a “war” risks repeating the same minimization that enabled the very atrocities the Convention was created to prevent in the first place. To be clear, acknowledging genocide in Gaza doesn’t excuse or diminish Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror attacks and war crimes that killed over 1,200 people and took 251 people hostage. These are two independent legal tracks that both require accountability. The Genocide Convention simply makes no exception for self‑defense or counterterrorism, and history shows that waiting for conclusive court rulings, which often take years or decades, has too often meant ignoring atrocities in real time. My responsibility, then, is to use language that’s consistent with the determinations of the UN, leading human rights organizations, and genocide scholars who have already found that the threshold for genocide has been met.

### *Site features*

**What does the 📌 mean?** Where possible, I like to "re-up" news from the past to contextulize a current story without having to regurgitate all the past information. By pinning past abstract summaries in a sequential order below a new news story, we can tell a richer narrative without repeating information you may already know. And if you haven't been following along or you forgot, then the most salient background information is right there for ya.

**What are the ✏️ Notables?** WTFJHT is (usually) comprised of two parts: the main section, which is a numbered list of abstract summaries, and the Notables. The main section is typically your largest, most impactful stories of the day threaded together to form some sort of narrative. The Notables, however, are a _noting_ of all the other important stories that happened, but didn't fit the larger daily narrative. The Notables section was created following reader feedback for more stories in the daily update. 

**Is there an RSS feed?** Yep! Here are links to the <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/rss.xml">RSS</a>, <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/atom.xml">Atom</a>, and <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/feed.json">JSON</a> feeds.

### *Policies & boundaries*

**I'm running for office, will you share my campaign with your audience?** No. My promise to readers is that I'll tell them WTF just happened today and not push my personal politics. In exchange, members invest in WTFJHT to tell them _what happened_; not what to think.

**Why do you use serif font and not sans-serif? Don't you know sans-serif is the superior typeface? And, yo, what's up with the red links? Blue links are the standard on the web.** Like a newspaper, WTFJHT is black and white and read all over. 

**What is the technology behind WTFJHT?** WTFJHT is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, [GitHub](https://github.com/) and GitHub Actions, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. This project is open sourced and hosted as a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/mkiser/WTFJHT). Log new [issues, comments, feedback here](https://github.com/mkiser/WTFJHT/issues).

**I don't like the word "fuck."** If you're offended by the word "fuck" on the internet in today's political climate, then I don't know what to tell ya.

### *WTF does it cost to run this thing?*

_Last updated: August 2025_

***TL;DR***: The baseline budget with no operating reserve is **$16,778/month**; The sustainable budget with an operating reserve is **more like ~$18,876/month**.

---

**OPERATING COSTS**: 
1. **Hosting & infrastructure** (S3, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, etc.): **$200/month**
2. **News subscriptions** (NYT, WaPo, WSJ, Bloomberg, creator journalists, etc.): **$175/month**
3. **Transaction Fees** (the unavoidable cost of Stripe fees are 2.9% + $0.30 on every credit card transaction): **~$1,000/month**
4. **Small-business overhead** (depreciation, backups, monitoring, training, and other tools): **$400/month**
5. **Tools & services** (MailChimp, Memberful, Algolia, Osmosys, S3Stat, GitHub, Buffer, Zapier, etc.): **$1,679/month**

_Total Operating Costs: **$41,448/year ($3,454/month)**_

**MATT'S LIVING WAGE**: \
This is a one-person operation, which means your support funds the reporting, writing, editing, fact-checking, production of the newsletter, maintenance of the site and tools, light web development and operations, and audience development — plus all the unglamorous bits like customer support, vendor wrangling, and fixes when things break. It’s all one job. I publish the math because I believe transparency builds trust and you deserve to see how your support translates into the product. In short, my living wage is what it takes for me to show up and do the job.

I spend about half my time on editorial work, with the other half split between product/tech and operations. To arrive at fair compensation, I blend local labor markets for the roles I actually perform, weighted by time. I don’t tack on a monthly “inflation” line item. Instead, I re-index the base periodically and re-run the math so my "pay" roughly tracks real costs without hiding anything. The blended salaries result in a **base compensation of $109,045/year ($9,087/month)** for someone doing this mix of work in the Seattle, WA area.

In a normal job, an employer pays for **benefits** like health insurance, retirement match, paid time off, disability and life insurance, professional liability, bookkeeping/tax prep, and admin overhead. As a solo operator, I pay those at “retail” and self-fund PTO. Rather than hiding that inside a bigger salary number, I show it explicitly. Benefits are typically **30–35%** of compensation, so I'll just use the midpoint of **32.5%** because that seems fair: **32.5% × $109,045 = $35,440/year ($2,953/month)**

And then there’s the **self-employment tax**. A regular employer pays payroll taxes on top of salary, but when you’re self-employed, you pay both sides (Social Security + Medicare). I don’t include income taxes because they’re household-specific and not a business operating cost anyway. Self-employment tax is **15.3%** applied to **92.35%** of net earnings: **0.9235 × $109,045 × 15.3% = $15,408/year ($1,284/month)**

_Total Living Wage: **$159,892/year ($13,324/month)**_

---

**OPERATING RESERVE**: \
Because reader support is voluntary and variable, a small operating reserve is required to smooth out cash-flow gaps, cover unexpected bills, and account for the general unknown risk associated with running a small business that "sells" a free product. Again, I'd rather publish this explicitly than bury the volatility inside “labor.” The suggested range is **10–15%**, so I'll use the midpoint of **12.5%**.

_Total Operating Reserve: **$25,168/year ($2,097/month)**_

---

***TOTAL ALL-IN COST TO RUN WTFJHT***:
1. Operating costs: **$41,448/year ($3,454/month)** 
2. Living wage: **$159,892/year ($13,324/month)** 
3. Operating Reserve: **$25,168/year ($2,097/month)**

**GRAND TOTAL: $226,508/year ($18,876/month)**
