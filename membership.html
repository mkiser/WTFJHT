<p>It's not enough to be a consumer of media. You should be a stakeholder in it. WTFJHT isn’t in the content business. It’s in the relationship business. If this once‑a‑day briefing helps you make sense of the news, become a supporting member so it can stay free for everyone who needs it. About 2% of readers underwrite access for the other 98%.</p>

<p>What The Fuck Just Happened Today? is an independent, ad-free, and reader-funded newsletter and blog that's been chronicling the daily shock and awe in national politics since 2017. It's produced by <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/author/matt-kiser/">Matt</a>, a real life human, once a day and published every afternoon, Monday through Thursday. More than 200,000 people rely on WTFJHT for the day's political news in a concise and focused recap.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>Here's the deal:</strong> This is my full‑time job. And, I plan to keep doing this for as long as you keep supporting me. The blog and newsletter has always been free and is sustained entirely by voluntary reader contributions, and I'm determined to keep it both free and sustainable. Membership isn’t charity. It’s an investment in the continued production of WTF Just Happened Today? and pays for a fair living wage, the tools, and the systems necessary to keep writing and reporting without interruption. It also unlocks free access for readers who can’t afford to pay – and that’s the whole point.</p>

<p><i>So if you rely on WTFJHT, invest in the continued production of WTFJHT by becoming a supporting member so I can continue to tell you wtf just happened today</i>.</p> 

<p><strong>How the math maths</strong>: About 2% of readers underwrite WTFJHT, which unlocks free access for everyone else. While delivering the newsletter is cheap, it's not free. It costs about $1.81 per year to send WTFJHT to one subscriber. With an current average contribution of $5.89/month, each member effectively “pays for” ~39 free readers every month. But wait, there's more! About 13% of members cancel each year (for all the normal it's-not-you-it's-me life reasons), which works out to ~50 people a month. So to keep membership flat, I need to welcome ~50 new members every month (about 600 per year!) before I can grow, let alone run fewer membership drives.</p>

<p><strong><em>Said another way</em></strong>: your $5/month moves the needle.</p>

<p><strong>Editorial Policy</strong>: This is the news through the lens of a person making decisions about coverage – much the same way a front page editor does for newspapers. With every blurb I write, I'm make a news-value judgement. There's a natural tension here: First, humans making decisions about the relative importance of information is inherently biased. And second, journalism is a set of ethics based on trust, truthfulness, fairness, integrity, independence, and accountability. My goal with WTF Just Happened Today? is to acknowledge my personal bias, reflect journalistic standards, and apply the following standards and practices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>WTFJHT takes a <strong>neutral-ish position</strong>. It's not intentionally partisan. It's purposefully fact-based. It focuses on clearly and concisely saying what happened, citing the primary sources, and moving on. Bias is the byproduct of being a human making decisions.</li>
  <li>WTFJHT <strong>doesn't offer commentary, opinion, or analysis</strong>. Adjectives and adverbs are generally stripped out of the writing so facts are framed as fact. It's unncessary to add a "just" in front of <em>8% of Americans approve of the job the president is doing</em>. Any reasonable person can understand that that's probably not a good job approval rating, right?</li>
  <li>WTFJHT's value is derived from its reputation and promise to the readers. The voice, tone, consistency, and being a reasonable person are all in service of building trust. If I break this promise, I break the trust of the reader.</li>
</ol>

<p>Above all else, with WTFJHT you can expect an independent voice that is personally accountable and considerate for how the editorial choices impact others. I go to great lengths to cite the original source of news and draw from a diversity of sources.</p>

<ul>

	<li>"Single subject, distinct tone, clear formatting, total understanding of what its audience wants. WTFJHT is the best email newsletter." –<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/830907636006547456" target="_blank">Dave Lee</a>, BBC Silicon Valley Reporter</li>

<p><small><strong>How do I login to my membership account?</strong> If you're on the Memberful platform (most members are), you can <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/account">sign-in here</a>. If you're on <a href="https://donorbox.org/user_session/new">DonorBox</a>, this is your sign-in page.

<p><small><strong>Can I update my email address or other personal information?</strong> Yes. <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/account">Log in to your account here</a> to make these changes. </small></p>

<p><small><strong>Does unsubscribing from the newsletter automatically cancel my recurring membership?</strong> No. If you'd like to cancel or edit your recurring membership, please use the links provided in your receipt emails (or the appropriate link above) to manage your membership. Because WTFJHT is free but supported by optional contributions, it's not possible to make the assumption that someone unsubscribing from the newsletter also wants to cancel their patronage. In many cases, supporting members do not and have never been newsletter subscribers (e.g. a blog reader or Twitter followers). For these reasons, I provide members with the tools to manage their account at any time for any reason.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>How do I cancel my membership?</strong> For Memberful members, log in to your account and <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/account/subscriptions">toggle auto-renew off</a> from the "Subscriptions" menu item.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>Are you a 501(c)(3)? Is my contribution tax-deductible?</strong> No, I'm a for-profit, single-member LLC based in Washington State. There are two reasons for this: 1) this setup makes it easy to manage and keeps my operational overhead low, and 2) I strongly believe media businesses need to be in the business of being in business. Meaning, my ability to fund WTFJHT is a reflection of the value created for the readers. If enough readers don't find WTFJHT valuable enough to pay for, then maybe WTFJHT shouldn't exist anymore.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>How much does this thing cost to run anyway?</strong> Glad you asked! I did some back of the envelope math and I came up with a baseline estimate of <u>$16,778/month</u>. If you're interested in how I arrived at that number, I've outlined <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faq/#wtf-does-it-cost-to-run-this-thing">the cost of running WTFJHT in the FAQ</a>.</small></p>
