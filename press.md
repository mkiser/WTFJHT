1/ **Meet the wildly popular blogger chronicling President Trump one day at a time**. The site is easy to read, easy to parse and easy to share. There are no ads, and WTF Happened Today makes it easy to see news in context with what happened yesterday and the day before that. ([Poynter](http://www.poynter.org/2017/meet-the-wildly-popular-blogger-chronicling-president-trump-one-day-at-a-time/448894/){:target="_blank"})

2/ **A new entrant that displays perhaps the most accurate encapsulation of this peculiar moment** takes the form of an independent email blast: “What The Fuck Just Happened Today?” The aptly named roundup does the yeoman’s work. ([Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/criticism/donald-trump-news-cycle-slow-news-day.php){:target="_blank"})

3/ **How WTF Just Happened Today? is Rethinking Membership**. It feels like a million years ago now, but in January 2017 the headlines were dominated by discussions over the size of the crowd at President Trump’s inauguration, “alternative facts,” the Women’s March, the Travel Ban, and more. What started as a side project for Kiser had unexpectedly grown into a more substantial undertaking. Kiser quit his job and began working on WTFJHT fulltime. The project has continued past the 100-day mark. Now he had to make a living from it. And he had to figure out how to grow it. ([The Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/solution-set/2018/03/08/wtf-just-happened-today-rethinking-membership/){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Combine an “editorially responsible” algorithm + political news, and you have Current Status**. “I see my role as a sort of reinforcement editor, ensuring that the good stuff is always percolating to the top.

10/ **Follow these newsletters by journalists and never miss a thing**. A very unique concept for a daily update of what’s happening and a very spot on title for it, given how crazy things can get these days.

Every piece of news is described with a single sentence, which pretty much summarizes the gist of it all.

14/ **Don’t get raked, keep abreast of daily shock and awe from DC**. Kiser does an ace job of the old blogger skill called “curating.” His lists surface themes and suggest lines that might connect dots. His headlines make dark poetry of careering developments.

19/ **Best New Website: Read "What The Fuck Just Happened" every day**. The site is really fun, in a sort of masochistic, sicko way.

25/ **WTF just happened today? Ask Matt Kiser.**
