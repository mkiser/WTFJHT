      <description><![CDATA[1/ Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses. These teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration. (New York Times)

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge**. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses. These teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/immigration-raids-enforcement.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **The Trump administration is turning on Mike Flynn while the CIA freezes out Flynn’s aide**. The agency denied a security clearance for a key aide to the National Security Adviser, effectively ending his tenure on the National Security Council and escalating tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/mike-flynn-nsa-aide-trump-234923){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **Flynn holds call with Pence amid calls for probes of contacts with Russian ambassador**. Flynn had urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to punitive sanctions being imposed on Russia by the Obama administration, signaling that the Trump administration would revisit the issue when it took office. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flynn-holds-call-with-pence-amid-calls-for-probes-of-contacts-with-russian-ambassador/2017/02/10/f8fb83a0-efe1-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **GOP bill would gut EPA**. A House Republican is sponsoring legislation to do away with large portions of the Environmental Protection Agency, including environmental justice and greenhouse gas programs. The Wasteful EPA Programs Elimination Act would save $7.5 billion annually and would leave the EPA with a budget of less than $1 billion. Major EPA climate change programs would be eliminated under the measure. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/318931-gop-bill-would-gut-epa){:target="_blank"})

4/ **Trump: Refugees are flooding the U.S. and creating a “dangerous” situation** after the judge blocked his travel ban. The percentage of refugees arriving from the so-called seven banned countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — has risen considerably since the directive was suspended. However, the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. All are stringently vetted. Trump made the post at the start of a day of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort in Jupiter, Florida.

5/ **The Justice Department is taking a step back from efforts to protect transgender people under existing law**. The department withdrew a request to limit an injunction halting enforcement of existing civil rights laws that provide protections for transgender people. The moves suggests that the federal government’s position on the pending legal questions surrounding transgender people’s rights could be changing soon. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/justice-department-takes-a-step-back-from-effort-to-protect){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Hundreds of protests against Planned Parenthood and counterprotests in support of the nonprofit are taking place across the country today**. A national coalition opposed to abortion rights seeks to end any public funding for Planned Parenthood. Supporters of Planned Parenthood are rallying today to show solidarity for the nonprofit organization, which provides a variety of health services including cancer screenings, HIV testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections as well as family planning, birth control and abortion. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hundreds-protests-planned-parenthood-set-today/story?id=45424516){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Al Franken to Maher: GOP senators privately express "great concern" about Trump’s temperament**. Franken isn't the first Democrat to say Republicans senators are privately fretting. Sen. Sherrod Brown said his GOP colleagues privately worry about Trump's “incompetence” and “ethics.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/11/al-franken-tells-maher-gop-senators-privately-express-great-concern-about-trumps-temperament/){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **Trump to Dems: "Pocahontas is now the face of your party”** – his insult of choice for Elizabeth Warren. Trump said the only reason Warren claimed Native American heritage was "because she has high cheekbones.” Trump was referencing questions over Warren's ancestry from her 2012 Senate race. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-voter-fraud/){:target="_blank"})

8/ **Trump: Border wall price "will come WAY DOWN" when I negotiate**. Trump responded to reports that the cost of his proposed border wall is much higher than expected, insisting that it will be much cheaper after he gets involved in negotiations. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319070-trump-border-wall-price-will-come-way-down-when-i-negotiate){:target="_blank"})

9/ **"We're going to see more" sanctuary cities cave in face of Trump's funding threats**. Several towns, cities and counties around the nation are caving to President Trump's threat to pull funding, and abandoning their "sanctuary" pledges to shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities. The changes come on the heels of Trump’s executive order giving the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security the power to cut federal funding to communities that are deemed sanctuaries for illegal immigrants. Trump also has authorized the DHS to publish a weekly list of sanctuary communities. ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/10/were-going-to-see-more-sanctuary-cities-cave-in-face-trumps-funding-threats.html){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

*  **"A sense of dread" for civil servants shaken by the Trump transition**. Across the vast federal bureaucracy anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance has spread among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/a-sense-of-dread-for-civil-servants-shaken-by-trump-transition.html){:target="_blank"})

10/ **Utah’s Rep. Jason Chaffetz faces the “Resistance" in his home state**. The backlash was not just about policy—it was fueled by anger that the congressman was shirking his duty as chairman of the House Oversight Committee by refusing to investigate Trump. In their view, his was not just a failure of government, but of character. Despite Utah’s status as one of the most conservative states in the country, Trump has never been very popular there. He carried the state’s electoral votes last year with just 45 percent of the vote. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/inside-the-utah-resistance/516303/){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **Chaffetz said the protestors were Democrats and paid to demonstrate** and disrupt his town hall because they don't like Trump and are upset about the results of the 2016 election. ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/chaffetz-town-hall-believes-paid-protestos){:target="_blank"})

11/ **State G.O.P. leaders move swiftly as party bickers in Congress**. While Republicans in Washington appear flummoxed by the complexities of one-party rule, rising party leaders in the states seem far more at ease and assertive. Republicans have top-to-bottom control in 25 states now, holding both the governorship and the entire legislature, and Republican lawmakers are acting with lightning speed to enact longstanding conservative priorities. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/state-republican-leaders-move-swiftly.html){:target="_blank"})

12/ **Army veterans return to Standing Rock to form a human shield against police**. A growing group of military veterans are willing to put their bodies between Native American activists and the police trying to remove them. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/11/standing-rock-army-veterans-camp){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* Earlier: **When asked if Trump was considering signing a new executive order on immigration: "Nothing's off the table.”** Trump also has the option of going back to the drawing board and coming up with a new way to impose "extreme vetting" restrictions he says are necessary. But it seems certain he will not take the route since to do so would involve not only admitting the bitter taste of a high stakes legal defeat but repudiating the combative win-at-all-costs attitude that animates his character. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-politics/index.html){:target="_blank"})

2/ **US investigators corroborate some aspects of the Russia dossier** compiled by a former British intelligence agent. None of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier. The intercepts do confirm that some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/russia-dossier-update/index.html){:target="_blank"})

3/ **Russia considers returning Snowden to U.S. to "curry favor" with Trump**. Trump has called the NSA leaker a "spy" and a "traitor" who deserves to be executed. Russia considers turning over Snowden to be a "gift" to Trump. ([ABC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921){:target="_blank"})

4/ **National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials**. Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **Did Mike Pence get burned by Michael Flynn?** Either the national security adviser misled the vice president, or the vice president knowingly misled the American people. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/02/10/daily-202-did-mike-pence-get-burned-by-michael-flynn/589d13ffe9b69b1406c75ca2/){:target="_blank"})

5/ **Trump tells President Xi Jinping U.S. will honor the "One China" Policy**, reversing his earlier expressions of doubt about the longtime diplomatic understanding and removing a major source of tension between the United States and China since shortly after he was elected. Trump had to publicly commit to upholding the 44-year-old policy for President Xi to take his call. The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **The US's One-China policy explained**: It has been the policy of the United States to recognize Taiwan as part of China. The one-China policy is the delicate balance between respecting China's claim to the territory and maintaining close ties to Taiwan. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/uss-china-policy-explained/story?id=43983884){:target="_blank"})
* **Trump's retreat over Taiwan and China's currency may be tactical**. Trump has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods. If he follows through with that, the result could be a trade war that damages both economies. But, talking with China, rather than trading threats, could help Trump come away with some kind of deal on issues like import tariffs and currencies that he could tout as a victory. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/news/economy/trump-china-taiwan-threats-trade/index.html){:target="_blank"})

6/ **Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks**. Kushner’s back-channel communications with Mexico reveals he’s operating like a shadow secretary of state, operating outside the boundaries of the State Department or National Security Council. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-a-shadow-diplomat-pulls-the-strings-on-us-mexico-talks/2017/02/09/aed2cf80-ef0b-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html){:target="_blank"})

7/ **Tom Price confirmed as the new secretary of Health and Human Services**. He was approved by a party-line vote of 52-47. Democrats were concerned that the conservative congressman wants to pare down government health programs. They were also troubled by lingering ethics questions over Price's investments. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/10/514365195/tom-price-confirmed-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services){:target="_blank"})

_Related:_

* **12.2 million people have signed up for Obamacare this year**, even with the uncertainty created by Trump's vow to repeal and replace it. Enrollment is about 4 percent lower than last year, the sizable number of sign-ups illustrates the risk Republicans face as they begin moving to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and put in its place a yet-to-be-defined conservative approach. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-10/12-2-million-sign-up-for-obamacare-despite-its-problems?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business){:target="_blank"})

8/ **Kellyanne Conway apologized to Donald Trump after Ivanka clothing line comments**. Conway, in a Fox News interview, urged viewers Thursday to "go buy Ivanka's stuff.” The top White House adviser tweeted that she had the full support of Trump. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/kellyanne-conway-tweets-potus-supports-me/index.html){:target="_blank"})

9/ **Trump border wall to cost $21.6 billion and take 3.5 years to build**, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report. The report’s estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign. ([Reuters](http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-immigration-wall-idINKBN15O2ZZ){:target="_blank"})

10/ **Treasury nominee vows no tax cut for rich. But the math says the opposite.** Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/business/economy/mnuchin-rule-tax-cut.html){:target="_blank"})

11/ **Trump vexed by challenges, scale of government**. The president’s allies say he has been surprised that government can’t be run like his business. Nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing, from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in-fighting and leaks. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/donald-trump-challenges-governing-presidency-234879){:target="_blank"})

12/ **Republicans push bill to split up "nutty 9th Circuit”**. They argue that the 9th is too big, too liberal and too slow resolving cases. If they succeed, only California, Oregon, Hawaii and two island districts would remain in the 9th's judicial fiefdom. Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska would be part of the brand new 12th Circuit. ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/09/bill-to-split-nutty-9th-circuit-gains-momentum.html){:target="_blank"})

13/ **A blueprint for resistance to Trump has emerged. Here’s what it looks like:** faith in the system, pressure Republicans to exercise oversight, use all the procedural tools in the Senate, leverage civil society, keep Trump distracted. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/10/a-blueprint-for-resistance-to-trump-has-emerged-heres-what-it-looks-like/){:target="_blank"})

14/ **FBI terrorism taskforce investigating Standing Rock activists**. FBI representatives have contacted several "water protectors," raising alarm that an indigenous-led movement is being construed as domestic terrorism.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Trump Picks Neil Gorsuch, A Scalia Clone, For The Supreme Court.** Ideologically, Gorsuch would almost certainly represent a reliably conservative vote and voice. Gorsuch would be the most conservative justice save for the silent stalwart Justice Clarence Thomas and would sit somewhere just to the right of the ideological space occupied by Scalia. ([FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-trump/))

> UPDATE: **What Gorsuch means for the Supreme Court**. 13 top legal scholars weigh in. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-future-214724))

_Related:_ 

  * **Where Gorsuch would fit on the Supreme Court**. Should he be confirmed, the court will return to a familiar dynamic, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holding the decisive vote in many closely divided cases. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-nominee.html))

  * **Who Is Neil Gorsuch?** Like Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch has cultivated a reputation as a memorable and clear author of legal opinions. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/511850519/who-is-neil-gorsuch-trumps-first-pick-for-the-supreme-court)) 
  
  * **Why Liberals should back Gorsuch.** One basic criterion should be paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the rule of law and say no to a president or Congress that strays beyond the Constitution and laws? ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/why-liberals-should-back-neil-gorsuch.html))

  * **Why Democrats should oppose Gorsuch.** The presumption should be that Gorsuch does not deserve confirmation, because the process that led to his nomination was illegitimate. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/neil-gorsuch-how-democrats-should-respond.html))
 
 2/ **Trump to McConnell: Go nuclear if necessary**. But McConnell, a well-known institutionalist, has been noncommittal about whether he would invoke the so-called “nuclear option” to force Gorsuch through the upper chamber. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317348-trump-to-mcconnell-go-nuclear-if-necessary))

 _Related:_ 

  * **Make Republicans nuke the filibuster to confirm Gorsuch.** Once Mitch McConnell blockaded Barack Obama’s last Supreme Court nomination, and then Donald Trump carried the Electoral College, the chance that Republicans would fill the vacancy rose to 100 percent. McConnell already indicated that he does not respect Democrats’ right to filibuster, and that he would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations if one is used. It is McConnell, his extraordinary blockade tactic, who has functionally changed the rules of the game. He should be forced to do it in name.

([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317035-sessions-approved-by-senate-committee))

5/ **Republicans suspend committee rules, advance Mnuchin, Price nominations** after confronting a boycott from Democrats. Senate Committee rules normally require at least one Democratic senator present to have a vote. But when Democrats refused to show, the committee's chairman suspended those rules. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/))

6/ **Two Republican senators says they aren't committed to voting for Betsy DeVos** on Senate floor. Democrats say they have 48 votes against DeVos on the floor but need 51 — and they have been looking for Republican votes against her.

6/ **Trump’s hard-line actions have an intellectual godfather: Jeff Sessions.** The senator lobbied for a “shock and awe” period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump’s base and catch his critics unaware.

2/ **Despite growing dissent, Trump gives no sign of backing down from travel ban** even as lawmakers from both parties spoke out against the action and federal judges ruled against parts of it. Judicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement President Trump’s action.

3/ **A clarifying moment in American history.** There should be nothing surprising about what the Donald Trump has done in his first week, but he had underestimated the resilience of Americans and their institutions. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/a-clarifying-moment-in-american-history/514868/))

4/ **Donald Trump, the refugee ban, and the triumph of cruelty.** The reasons for Trump’s ban on refugees could not be more feeble, and could not be more petty. It serves no actual security purpose. You have a better chance of getting killed by a train, or by your own clothes catching on fire, than by an immigrant terrorist attack. The odds of a refugee killing you in a terrorist strike are about 1 in 3.6 billion. That's about four hundred times less likely than being hit by lightning twice. If you look back at significant terrorist attacks in the US like San Bernardino or the Pulse nightclub shooting or 9/11, exactly none of them would have been prevented by this policy.

6/ **Trump signs two more executive actions.** The first bans administration officials who leave government from lobbying those federal agencies for five years, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The second is a memorandum giving military leaders 30 days to construct and present a "comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS," stating that "there can be no accommodation or negotiation" with the group. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316701-admin-trump-to-issue-three-more-executive-orders))

7/ **Trump's state department purge sparks worries of 'know-nothing approach' to foreign policy.** The sudden dismissal of several senior officials has left a gaping hole at the heart of US diplomacy: "The machinery is still there, but no one’s in the cockpit." ([The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/state-department-purge-trump-foreign-policy))

8/ **Trump continued his longstanding assault on media outlets.** This time labeling the NY Times as "fake news," and said that it and the Washington Post's coverage of Trump has been "so false and angry." It is unclear as to what prompted Trump's criticism. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-calls-the-new-york-times-washington-post-dishonest-234304))

      <description><![CDATA[1/ Trump’s order blocks immigrants at airports, stoking fear around the globe. The executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the executive order also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States. (NY Times)

> **UPDATE:** A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees who were trapped at airports across the United States.
>
>The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Trump’s actions.

2/ **A federal judge issued a stay against Donald Trump's "Muslim Ban".** The ruling – a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office – protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called "Muslim ban." It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed. ([Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/muslim-ban-federal-court))

4/ **Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban.** Administration officials weren't immediately sure which countries' citizens would be barred from entering the United States. The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the President himself, according to court filings. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/index.html))

5/ **Facing intense criticism, some Republicans are speaking out against Trump’s refugee ban.** Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren’t among them.

6/ **The silence from Silicon Valley had been deafening.** After weeks of deafening silence and quiet acquiescence, top tech leaders finally began to react strongly to policies of the new administration, spurred by a capricious immigration ban on some Muslim countries ordered by Trump.

7/ **‘Up Is Down’: Trump's unreality show echoes his business past.** Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand.

Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priority for admission would be given to Christians. (Washington Post)

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Trump executive order suspends admission of all refugees for 120 days** while a new system is put in place to tighten vetting for those from predominantly Muslim countries and give preference to religious minorities. Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priority for admission would be given to Christians.

2/ **The extreme vetting plan to establishes a religious test** for refugees from Muslim nations. The order also stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html)) 

3/ **The order will block 500,000 legal U.S. residents from returning to American from trips abroad.** The president has also used language that will affect those who are in the U.S. already on visas and green cards. ([ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america/))

4/ **Trump's immigration ban excludes countries with business ties.** His proposed list doesn’t include Muslim-majority countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey. ([Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/))

5/ **Trump's immigration ban is illegal.** More than 50 years ago, Congress outlawed such discrimination against immigrants based on national origin. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html))

6/ **Following Trump’s executive order green card, visa holders already blocked by airports.** Within hours of the executive order limiting immigration from Muslim countries, green card and visa holders were already being blocked from getting on flights to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 p.m. ordering the Customs and Border Protection to enforce the executive order. People who were still in the air as of 10:30 p.m. likely face being blocked at the airport when their planes land, he said. ([NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-order-blocks-green-card-visa-holders-airports-article-1.2957910))

7/ **A little-noticed move by Trump could make it easier to deport immigrants.** The move stripped federal privacy protections from many immigrants, raising fears among advocacy groups that information people willingly submitted to the federal government during the Obama administration could now be used to help deport them. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-little-noticed-move-by-trump-could-make-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants/2017/01/27/fd5734ec-e4cb-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html))

8/ **Governing without a script.** Trumps seems to be running his administration much like he ran his company and campaign, eager to weigh in on every issue and willing to make last-minute calls. ([Wall Stree Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-first-week-governing-without-a-script-1485544924))

9/ **Trump blows up the U.S.-Mexico relationship.** In one of his first instances of Twitter diplomacy as President, Trump wrote, “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” Not surprisingly, Peña Nieto cancelled. ([The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-blows-up-the-u-s-mexico-relationship))

10/ **The theater of access.** Trump’s relationship with the media may be obsessive, but it’s also deeply transactional — the media has always been a tool in his pursuit of fame and power. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/magazine/donald-trump-and-the-theater-of-access.html))
 
11/ **The Bannon coup.** White House and Hill GOP leaders are astonished by the unambiguous, far-reaching power of Steve Bannon and policy guru Stephen Miller over, well, just about everything.([Axios](http://www.axios.com/the-bannon-coup-2218491076.html))

12/ **Trump’s first seven days in office were historic, chaotic, astonishing and unsettling.** With a flurry of provocative executive orders, surreal events, unapologetic falsehoods and did-he-really-say-that tweets, Trump continued to obliterate political norms, serving notice that the gaze of history won’t change who he is. He made so much news and did so many unorthodox things that it was hard to keep track of everything that was changing in Washington. The question, though, is what did all that sound and fury signify? ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/president-trump-week-one-first-administration-214699))

13/ **Republican lawmakers fret about how to repeal Obamacare.** Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party’s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act inside a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-closed-doors-republican-lawmakers-fret-about-how-to-repeal-obamacare/2017/01/27/deabdafa-e491-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html))

14/ **Pence vows "full evaluation of voting rolls" over claims of fraud.** In a private meeting with congressional Republicans this week, the Trump administration would pursue a wide-ranging probe of voting rolls in the United States to examine whether millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election as President Trump has charged. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/in-private-meeting-pence-vows-full-evaluation-of-voting-rolls-over-claims-of-voting-fraud/2017/01/27/1c1fa1de-e49a-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html))

15/ **Can a president who disregards the truth uphold his oath of office?** His job demands a basic level of respect for the concepts of law and meaning. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/27/can-a-president-who-disregards-the-truth-uphold-his-oath-of-office/))

16/ **Trump backers like his first draft of a New America.** Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved — freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several Muslim-majority nations. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/trump-backers-like-his-first-draft-of-a-new-america.html))]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Steve Bannon says media should "keep its mouth shut."** Trump’s chief strategist, laced into the American press during an interview, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by an election outcome few anticipated, and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html))

2/ **One of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science.** It is no coincidence that the rise of Trump is concurrent with the rise of “fake news.” It is no coincidence that his rise comes during an age of severely damaged faith in institutions. Our president is a pathological liar. Say it. Write it. Never become inured to it. And dispense with the terms of art to describe it. A lie by any other name portends the same. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/a-lie-by-any-other-name.html))

3/ **Fake news is about to get even scarier than you ever dreamed.** What we saw in the 2016 election is nothing compared to what we need to prepare for in 2020. If there’s one thing we learned from this election cycle, it is that there are a number of reasons that people create fake-news stories. And, it has become clear that most new consumers don’t want to know if what they are reading is real or fake; they just want to know that it helps support their worldview. ([Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology))
  
4/ **The State Department's entire senior management team resigned.** Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s job running the State Department just got considerably more difficult. The entire senior level of management officials resigned as part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don’t want to stick around for the Trump era. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/01/26/the-state-departments-entire-senior-management-team-just-resigned/))

5/ **The Trump administration’s day one moves were copied from Mitt Romney's would-be playbook.** Literally. ([Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-trump-administrations-day-one-moves-were-copied-from-mit))

6/ **Trump pressured Park Service to find proof for his claims about inauguration crowd.** ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-pressured-park-service-to-back-up-his-claims-about-inauguration-crowd/2017/01/26/12a38cb8-e3fc-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html))

7/ **(The cost of) Trump's wall keeps getting higher and higher.** Republican Congressional leaders signaled plans to move forward with Trump's planned border wall, estimated to cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. That's well below many outside estimates of the construction cost (let alone maintenance), but is significantly higher than what Trump himself has said in the past. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/the-cost-of-trumps-wall-keepss-getting-higher-and-higher-2216737417.html))

8/ **Americans think Trump will be worst president since Nixon.** Voters are so dim on Trump that they think, in the first week of his administration, that he will prove to be a worse President than everyone who's held the office since Richard Nixon. ([Public Policy Polling](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/01/americans-think-trump-will-be-worst-president-since-nixon.html))

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Trump's voter fraud example?** A troubled tale about Bernhard Langer meant to illustrate rampant, unchecked voter fraud. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html))

> **tl;dr** Langer was standing in line at a polling place on Election Day. Ahead of and behind Langer were voters who "did not look as if they should be allowed to vote." Langer left feeling frustrated. *Here's the problem:* Langer, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., is a German citizen with permanent residence status in the United States who is, by law, barred from voting. 

2/ **Declining trust in government is denting democracy.** America, which has long defined itself as a standard-bearer of democracy for the world, has become a “flawed democracy” according to the taxonomy used in the annual Democracy Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although its score did not fall by much -- from 8.05 in 2015 to 7.98 in 2016 -- it was enough for it to slip just below the 8.00 threshold for a “full democracy”. ([The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20))

3/ **Trump's impulses now carry the force of the presidency.** Impetuous and instinctive, convinced of broad, but hidden plots to undermine him, eager to fight and prone to what an aide called “alternative facts,” Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/donald-trump-presidency.html))

4/ **Those flashy executive actions could run aground.** The White House failed to consult with many of the agencies and lawmakers who will be critical for their success. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-flashy-executive-actions-could-run-aground-234200))

5/ Oh, and **Donald Trump is building his wall on the Mexico border as undocumented crossing reaches a 40-year low.** In taking his first step towards building a US-Mexico border wall, Trump begins an attack on a vanishing issue. ([Quartz](https://qz.com/894606/trumps-executive-order-to-build-a-us-mexico-border-wall-attacks-a-vanishing-issue/))

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Trump believes millions voted illegally -- but provides no proof.** The claim has long been debunked. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/wh-trump-believes-millions-voted-illegally/))

2/ **Trump orders the construction of a Mexican border wall.** It's the first in a series of actions to curtail immigration and bolster national security. It includes slashing the number of refugees who can resettle in the United States and blocks Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering  temporarily. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html))

3/ **Federal works told to stop talking to Congress and the press.** The freeze has startled aides on the Hill and people at those agencies, who worry that it could abruptly upend current operations and stifle work and discussions that routinely take place between branches of government. ([Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-communication-freeze_us_58878b3ae4b0441a8f7114e2))

4/ **Trump has imposed a freeze on grants and contracts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.** ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-imposes-freeze-on-epa-grants-and-contracts)) Trump also banned employees from giving social media updates and speaking with reporters. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/315876-trump-bans-epa-employees-from-giving-social-media-updates))

5/ **USDA scientists have been put on lockdown.** “Starting immediately and until further notice” the department’s main research division “will not release any public-facing documents,” according to an internal memo. UPDATE: The order was rescinded by the department on Tuesday. ([Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/legacy_mobile/dinograndoni/trump-usda))

6/ **USDA disavows gag-order emailed to scientific research unit.** An internal email sent to staff at its Agricultural Research Service unit this week calling for a suspension of “public-facing documents,” including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-usda-idUSKBN1582OB))

7/ **A National Park deleted tweets on climate change after Trump silenced federal scientists.** The tweets were posted by a former employee and officials decided to delete them because the account had been “compromised,” a National Parks official said. ([Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/a-national-park-is-tweeting-facts-about-climate-change-in-de))

8/ **GOP Rep.: 'Better to get your news directly from the president."** The chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee said that Donald Trump was a more credible news source than the entire press corps. ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/lamar-smith-trump-liberal-media))

> **Spicer: The media "disposition should be" Trump is correct "unless we can prove otherwise”**
>
> "...at some point, the disposition should be he is going to do it unless we can prove otherwise. He has shown through every step of the way that he's going to win. And so it just seems to me it's just odd that if those are the odds, if you are looking at his track record, the track record is a proven track record of success and winning. And yet, the media's default is on every scenario, whether it's hasn't nominees getting through or winning a primary or him accomplishing something, it's immediately negative and a failure." ([Media Matters](https://mediamatters.org/video/2017/01/24/trump-press-secretary-media-disposition-should-be-trump-correct-unless-we-can-prove-otherwise/215116))

9/ **Trump’s disregard for the truth threatens his ability to govern.** In the first five days of his presidency, Trump has put the enormous power of the nation’s highest office behind spurious — and easily disproved — claims. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-disregard-for-the-truth-threatens-his-ability-to-govern/2017/01/24/945c81aa-e272-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html))

10/ **Trump dogged by insecurity over popular vote, media coverage.** He might hold the most powerful office in the world, but he's dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say. ([Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/61415760238042f2ad7bc38acc2f468c/trumps-bridge-building-eclipsed-false-voter-fraud-claim))

11/ **For Trump, everything is a rating.** Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1.8 million in 2009 — “looked like a million, a million and a half.” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts.” ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/arts/television/for-trump-everything-is-a-rating.html))

12/ **Trump 101: What he reads and watches.** 

> With an allergy to computers and phones, he works the papers. With a black Sharpie in hand, he marks up the Times or other printed stories. When he wants action or response, he scrawls the staffers' names on that paper and either hands the clip to them in person, or has a staffer create a PDF of it — with handwritten commentary — and email it to them. An amazed senior adviser recently pulled out his phone to show us a string of the emailed PDFs, all demanding response. It was like something from the early 90s. Even when he gets worked up enough to tweet, Trump told us in our interview he will often simply dictate it, and let his staff hit "send" on Twitter. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-101-what-he-reads-and-watches-2210510272.html))

13/ **"We the People" demand Trump release his tax returns.** One of the features on the White House website that didn’t vanish when President Trump took the oath of office on Friday is the “We the People” page, which allows ordinary Americans to petition their government to address an issue of importance to them. The Obama White House, which created the feature, responded to petitions that received at least 100,000 signatures within 30 days. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/opinion/we-the-people-demand-mr-trump-release-his-tax-returns.html))

      <description><![CDATA[1/ The first days inside Trump’s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot. President Trump had just returned to the White House on Saturday from his final inauguration event, a tranquil interfaith prayer service, when the flashes of anger began to build. (Washington Post)

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **The first days inside Trump’s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot.** President Trump had just returned to the White House on Saturday from his final inauguration event, a tranquil interfaith prayer service, when the flashes of anger began to build. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-first-days-inside-trumps-white-house-fury-tumult-and-a-reboot/2017/01/23/7ceef1b0-e191-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html))

2/ **Spicer: 'Negative' Trump coverage is ‘demoralizing’** The White House press secretary pushed back at what he said was negative coverage of the Trump White House, describing the media narrative as “demoralizing. It’s not just about a crowd size. There’s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has," Spicer said of Trump. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315721-spicer-negative-trump-coverage-is-demoralizing))

3/ **No White House leaks like this... until now.** The Trump White House not only leaks like crazy. It casually leaks the most intimate and humiliating details about the President - hurt feelings, ego injury, childlike behavior, self-destructive rages over tweets, media failure to credit his own grandiosity. We have simply never seen this level of leaking, with this little respect for the President's dignity or reputation, this early. ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/no-white-house-leaks-like-this-until-now))

4/ **Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.** Days after being sworn in, President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victory. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/))

5/ **Why Trump's staff is lying.** One of the most striking features of the early Trump administration has been its political uses of lying. The big weekend story was the obviously false claim that Trump pulled in the largest inauguration crowds in American history. This raises the question of why a leader might find it advantageous to promote such lies from his subordinates. ([Bloomber](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-23/why-trump-s-staff-is-lying))

6/ **The Right is building a new media "upside down" to tell Trump's story.** Armed with its own set of facts, the right has created a parallel media universe that’s risen all the way with Trump to the White House. ([Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-right-is-building-a-new-media-upside-down-to-tell-donald))

7/ **Trump pays a fence mending visit to the CIA after weeks of mocking U.S. intelligence officials.** Trump told staffers that he's now with them, "a thousand percent.” ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/23/511165541/president-trump-pays-a-fence-mending-visit-to-the-cia))

8/ An official said **the visit “made relations with the intelligence community worse”** and described the visit as “uncomfortable.” ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sources-say-theres-a-sense-of-unease-in-intel-community-after-trump-cia-visit/))

9/ **Trump names his Inauguration Day a ‘National Day of Patriotic Devotion’.** ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/trump-names-his-inauguration-day-a-national-day-of-patriotic-devotion/))

      <description><![CDATA[1/ The Trump Administration started with a big lie over a small thing. It wasn’t about an affair with an intern or in an attempt to wage war. The Trump administration kicked off with a whopper about the media’s role in maliciously minimizing the crowd size for Trump’s inauguration in a dastardly attempt to make him look bad.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **The Trump Administration started with a big lie over a small thing.** It wasn't about an affair with an intern or in an attempt to wage war. The Trump administration kicked off with a whopper about the media's role in maliciously minimizing the crowd size for Trump’s inauguration in a dastardly attempt to make him look bad. ([The Daily Best](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/22/trump-administration-starts-with-big-lie-over-small-thing.html))

2/ **Crowd scientists say Women's March in Washington was three times the size of the audience at Trump's inauguration** ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html)), and may have been the largest demonstration in US history. Marches held in more than 500 US cities were attended by at least 3.3 million people. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/2017/1/22/14350808/womens-marches-largest-demonstration-us-history-map))

3/ **Kellyanne Conway said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the White House had put forth “alternative facts”** to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/president-trump-inauguration-crowd-white-house.html))

> **KELLYANNE CONWAY:** Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What-- You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that. But the point remains--
>
> **CHUCK TODD:** Wait a minute-- Alternative facts?
>
> **KELLYANNE CONWAY:** --that there’s--
>
> **CHUCK TODD:** Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered, the one thing he got right--
>
> **KELLYANNE CONWAY:** --hey, Chuck, why-- Hey Chuck--
>
> **CHUCK TODD:** --was Zeke Miller. Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods. 

4/ **Alternative facts are a needless lie by the Trump Administration.**
If the president and his aides will tell easily disproven falsehoods about crowd sizes and speeches, what else will they be willing to dissemble about? ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/the-pointless-needless-lies-of-the-trump-administration/514061/))

5/ **The traditional way of reporting on a president is dead. And Trump’s press secretary killed it.** The presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he’s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called “a ratings machine.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-traditional-way-of-reporting-on-a-president-is-dead-and-trumps-press-secretary-killed-it/2017/01/22/75403a00-e0bf-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html))
 
6/ **The costs of Trump-branded reality: America's credibility.** When Trump swore the presidential oath, he assumed responsibility not only for the levers of government but also for one of the United States’ most valuable assets, battered though it may be: its credibility. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html))

7/ **Meanwhile, Trump's top aides are troubled by his rocky first weekend in office**, unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-aides-rocky-first-weekend.html))

8/ **WikiLeaks calls out Trump for refusing to release tax returns.** ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/wikileaks-trump-tax-return-234000))

9/ **Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments**, a team of prominent constitutional scholars, Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers say. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/trump-foreign-payments-constitution-lawsuit.html))

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Photos comparing Trump's inauguration crowd to the Women's March** ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-donald-trump-inauguration-sizes/index.html))

2/ **White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds.** "This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period," Spicer said, contradicting all available data. Aerial photos have indicated that former president Barack Obama's first inauguration attracted a much larger crowd. Nielsen ratings show that Obama also had a bigger television audience. Spicer, at times almost yelling while reading a prepared statement, took no questions. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/index.html))

3/ **Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media**, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html))

4/ **Trump says he has "running war" with media, criticizes the "dishonest media," gets facts wrong, in CIA speech.** ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/donald-trump-war-with-the-media/))

5/ At CIA headquarters, Trump denies feud, lashed out at critics, boasted of his magazine covers, and **exaggerated the size of the crowd at his inauguration.** ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-cia-langley-233971))

6/ **Trump’s real war isn’t with the media. It’s with facts.** He needs to delegitimize the media because he needs to delegitimize facts. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347952/trump-spicer-press-conference-crowd-size-inauguration))

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[1/ **Donald Trump has named only 29 of his 660 executive department appointments**, the Partnership for Public Service said. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/trump-cabinet-picks-inauguration.html))

2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an "unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout." **But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.** ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama))

3/ **All references to climate change have been deleted** from the White House website. The only mention of climate on Trump’s new website is under his “America First Energy Plan” page, in which he vows to destroy Obama’s Climate Action Plan, which is a government-wide plan to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. ([Motherboard](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website))

4/ **New poll shows Obamacare is more popular than Donald Trump.** Fox News finds that 50% of voters feel favorably about the Affordable Care Act compared to Donald Trump, whom 42% view favorably. President Obama received an approval rating of 60%. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14335268/obamacare-more-popular-than-trump-poll))

5/ **There's no record Trump has resigned from his companies.** To transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so))
