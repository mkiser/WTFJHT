* ***WTFJHT is the only newsletter I let into my inbox**. It's brief, clear, and covers the perfect selection of news in the perfect amount of words. –Steffi K.*
* ***Very readable, not confusing facts and opinions, the type of reporting I’ve really missed**. –Peter B.*
* ***Thanks for staring into the abyss so I don’t have to**. –Lynn P.*
* ***WTFJHT has become my lifeline**. I feel like I can tune out the chaos because I know I will receive the newsletter at the end of the day and can pursue further topics with the links you provide. I put aside a quiet time in the evening to do so and it makes all the horribleness that occurs each day a bit more manageable. –Laura K.*
* ***I don't need a blow-by-blow accounting of the news**. I continue to want a high-level, conversational summary that leaves me informed and I'm willing to forego details in favor of the summary WTF Just Happened Today provides." –Casey C.*
* ***Thanks to WTF Just Happened Today I don’t have to read the news more than once a day**. My quality of life is higher and I still have a clue about WTF just happened today. –Buster*

* ***This newsletter should win a news media award**. Indispensable. –Daniel L.* 
* *I've only been reading for a few weeks, but I must send you my regards for the excellent work you are doing here. **The clear and concise nature of your formatting/editing/sourcing is top notch**. It's also something rare to find out there; your sober style seems to elude most other writers/reporters/organizations. Which is not to say all the others are offering up pure junk (though many are...) but rather to say that **what you offer is something that I've long, long felt lacking from my news options**. Our lives are fast. They're busy with work and family. This stuff--the news?--it's boring, agitating, confusing, you name it. People want to be distracted from the grind and the bullshit, particularly now in the social media era more than ever. And so **your newsletter attempts to encapsulate that one particular world of the American federal government in a way that respects the readers time while still giving them the option to dig deeper** into the details and sources when they wish to. Frankly, Matt? **It's brilliant**. I wish I had stumbled upon this 1,420 days ago. But I suppose the present is the next best time. I've already forwarded and recommended to one friend, and I'm sure there will be more to follow. Lastly, I'd like to keep reading on for a few months first, but I definitely intend down the road to pitch in financially and help in whatever small way I can. For now, keep up the good fight.* –Kevin F.
* ***A shining light in a cave full of shit**. –Joe P.*
